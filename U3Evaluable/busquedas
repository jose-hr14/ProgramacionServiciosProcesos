8164 all Florence; the promenade where lounged all its fashionables of an 
8166 drive in the Cascini. The Guardie Nobili passed daily, in all their 
8170 scene; so that here might be said to meet, as in a focus, all that made 
8182 in handsome frames, and armor, cover the walls; while, scattered about,

8195 marble; the armor is papier mache, even to the owner himself, all is 
8204 individual to whom this consciousness brings no alloy of enjoyment; 
8205 Jekyl has persuaded himself to accept all as fact. Like the Indian, 
8223 that all the triumphs of cookery, all the splendor of equipage, all the 
8224 blandishments of beauty, all the fascinations of high society, may be 
8225 enjoyed by one who actually does not hold a “share in the company,” and, 
8238 He was, in all the society of the capital, not alone an admitted and 
8243 seemed to lie in the fact that, if generally easy to be found when 
8257 around him. His botany was a human classification, all his chemistry an 
8262 thought and action, not man in all the consciousness of power, and in 
8264 small humanity that he cared, for all the struggles and wiles and plots 
8266 its balls, its festivals, its intrigues, and its calamities. 
8268 He felt, with the great dramatist, that “all the world's a stage,” 
8271 friend Albert Jekyl, or, as he was popularly called by his acquaintance, 
8272 Le Due de Dine-out, to distinguish him from the Talleyrands, who are 
8294 Siberia. The Chaptowitsch, recalled in disgrace for asking one of Louis 
8296 half a dozen 'Legitimists,' with very stately manners and small 
8298 pleasant haunt for all seasons and at all hours, what is there? Nothing, 
8304 Pessarole, I really see nothing for the whole week. The Onslows, alone, 
8314 who is a confounded bore, the whole craft is deficient in ballast. But 
8326 too late; then, like every one else, you 'll have played all your trumps 
8331 though, in all probability, it will never conduce, save to very little 
8335 which, less from dandyism than pure self-love, he usually prolonged 
8341 his costume, while partaking of all the characteristics of the morning, 
8356 with that little wave of the hand so significative in all Italian 
8357 intercourse. Occasionally, indeed, a bland, regretful smile seemed to 
8358 convey the sorrow the refusal cost him; and once he actually placed his 
8364 coachman were all of the “seediest;” and Jekyl cried out, “Morlache!” 
8366 out his hand horizontally from his mouth, and blowing along the surface, 
8376 which defies all attempts at portraiture. Well-bred people, and their 
8377 amusements, are all constructed so perfectly alike, certain family

8458 terrible fear began to prevail that it was possible they meant all 
8468 all the affected ease and information of one who had known them for 
8483 not less decisive courts, which pronounce upon all questions of social 
8485 amongst them. High amid the number of these was a certain family called 
8488 maiden sister of the General. They inhabited a small house in a garden 
8490 had originally been the humble residence of a market-gardener, but, by 
8495 what service he became so was a small, delicate little man, with bland 
8497 all mild, gentle, and inoffensive, and his whole pursuit in life

8529 treatment, might have been fashioned into all the shapes and colors 
8531 equally misapplied and devoted to base uses, but which, by the touch 
8537 and creative power, that actually begot the great sublime it praised. 
8541 fitted all her slaves; and slaves were they of the most abject slavery, 
8545 need we should say more than that she was universally known as “Poor 
8546 Martha” by all their acquaintance. Oh! what patience, submission, and 
8550 one idol all her life, her brother; and although, when he married late 
8553 had been ministering for above thirty years. It was said that originally 
8558 passed years amid all the phantasmagoria of that unreal existence, and 
8561 alternatives, either to “believe the crusts mutton,” or be eternally 
8562 shut out from all hope. Who can tell the long and terrible struggle such 
8574 she had herself written to the publishers, she would swear all tributes 
8580 the animal had been a calf, rising from small beginnings, she had so 
8581 educated her faculties that now nothing was above her powers. Not all 
8583 not all the previous schemings and plottings, not all the discussions 
8589 a statute of the land. All her own doubts faded away on the instant; all 
8594 celebrated. Enough if we say that it was small and ill-arranged, its 
8596 objects by which it was filled. Stuffed lions stood in the hall; mock 
8600 curiosities, covered the walls on every side. Not a specimen amongst 
8606 genius, her “mind-worship,” as she called it, often led her into 
8623 recognized rendezvous of all who wanted to hear what was going on in the 
8626 contrary, it was “all taste and the musical glasses,” the “naughty talk”

8643 Haggerstone, a Russo-Polish Count Petrolaffski, a dark, sallow-skinned, 
8649 and a stutter, perpetually running about retailing gossip, which, by 
8650 some accident or other, he invariably got all wrong, never, on even the 
8656 all the quarterings and emblazonment of her family for centuries back. 
8660 “Have dey return your call, madam?” asked the Pole, with an almost 
8665 “Nor should we have gone at all, but Lady Foxington begged and entreated 
8667 said, 'you must really take them in hand.'”

8880 succession of objects, all new and dazzling, were but so many wonders to

2109 civilization, would there be a receiver over my estate of Mount Dalton? 
2110 Would the poor tenants be racked for the rent that I always gave time 
2111 for? Would there be a big poor-house, with its ugly front staring to

2135 into the adjoining room, where writing materials were prepared for him. 
2137 The two girls were standing at the fire as he entered; and simple as was 
2138 their dress, homely even to poverty, every trait of their costume, their 
2139 looks, bespoke them of gentle blood. Their anxious glances as he came 
2140 forward showed their eagerness to hear his tidings; but they did not

2144 fears. “Your father's illness has nothing serious about it. A few days 
2148 “Since my brother left us, sir, he appeared to sink hour by hour; he 
2149 cannot get over the shock,” said Ellen. 
2154 “With better health you 'll see his old courage return,” said the 
2155 doctor, as he hastily wrote a few lines of prescription, and then laying 
2158 and yet he hesitated, for he did not know how far they were compatible 
2159 with their means; nor could he venture upon the hazard of offending by 
2160 questioning them. As in his uncertainty he raised his eyes, they fell 
2161 upon the wooden figure which the dwarf had exhibited in the apothecary's 
2163 the foot of a cross, around which its arms were entwined. The emaciated 
2164 limbs and wasted cheek portrayed fasting and exhaustion, while in the

2181 Stooping down to examine it better, Grounsell was struck by the 
2182 expression of the face, whereon a smile of trustfulness and hope seemed 
2183 warring with the rigid lines of coming death; so that the impression 
2195 versed in every variety of the human expression in suffering, and of 
2198 to others more conversant with art than I am?” 
2200 “Upon one condition you may,” said the girl, in a low, deep voice. 
2204 “We are agreed, then?” 
2212 and here the difficulties pressed on every side, for while he scrupled 
2213 to accept what he deemed a gift of real value, he felt that they too had 
2214 a right to free themselves from the obligation that his presence as a

2217 acknowledgments and catching up the figure, departed. 
2219 Hans alone seemed dissatisfied at the result, for as he cast his wistful

2228 THE dreary weather of November showed no signs of “taking up.” Lowering 
2231 were left with so few resources to pass the time within. It is true they 
2232 did not make the best of the bad. Lady Hester grew hourly more irritable 
2233 and peevish. Sydney Onslow seldom left her room. George took to the 
2234 hills every morning, and never returned before a late dinner; while the 
2235 doctor, when not with Sir Stafford, spent all his time at the Dal tons', 
2239 while away the hours; she had spent whole days in letter-writing folios 
2240 of “tirades” to every one she could think of. She had all the carriages 
2241 inspected, and the imperials searched, for books she well knew had 
2242 been left behind. She had sent for the landlord's daughter to give her 
2243 lessons in German, which she thought of learning during the week. She 
2244 had given a morning to the Italian boy with his white mice, and pored 
2245 for hours long over the “Livre des Voyageurs,” reading the names of 
2246 friends who, with better fortune, had taken their departure for Italy. 
2247 But at last there came an end even to these frail resources, and she 
2250 the dreary time was unbroken by a single event, or uncheckered by a 
2253 they to be passed? was the fearful question to which she could find no 
2254 answer. She looked with actual envy at the party of boors who played at 
2255 dominos in the beer-house opposite, and followed with longing eyes the 
2256 little mail-cart as it left the village. If she could read Germau, there 
2258 turn, there was poverty enough to give her occupation from morn till 
2260 the manufacture that cannot work without its raw material, and with this 
2263 It was in this pitiable frame of mind she was walking up and down the 
2264 drawing-room one morning, just as the doctor had taken his departure, 
2265 and with him the last little scene that was to relieve the day, when 
2266 the servant entered with the card of Colonel Haggerstone, and the daily 
2269 Had the gallant colonel presented himself at Wilton Crescent, or the 
2270 Villa, it is more than likely that the well-instructed porter had not 
2272 consonants to gentle obscurity, while such an entry in the visiting-book 
2274 took up the card, and, instead of the habitual curt rejoinder, “Sir 
2279 riding-whip below stairs, was not a little amazed at the message. 
2280 There had been a time when he would have interpreted the favor most 
2282 passing the window, she was struck with me as I rode by.” Time had, 
2283 however, toned down these bright illusions, and he read the permission 
2286 the stairs; “the blockade was too strictly enforced not to tell at last. 
2289 The colonel had by this time given his whiskers and moustaches the 
2290 last curl, thrown back his head into a position of calm dignity, as the 
2291 servant, throwing wide the folding-doors, announced him. Advancing two

2306 as anyone can be in this wretched place. You heard, I suppose, of the 
2310 the possible pleasure her Ladyship might feel in a personal narrative, 
2312 Lady Onslow either did not think the occasion or the audience worth the 
2313 trouble of the exertion, and merely said, “We had a break-down somewhere 
2314 with an odious name. Sir Stafford would travel by that road through the 
2317 “Massena, I think,” said the colonel, at a haphazard, thinking that at 
2318 least the name was ben trovato, just as Sunday-school children father 
2319 everything remarkable on John the Baptist. 
2321 “Oh dear, no; it was Moreau. We stopped to breakfast at the little inn

2338 The colonel relieved her anxieties by the assurance that the next day 
2339 would be Monday, consequently that the present one was Sunday. 
2341 “How strange! One does make sad confusion in these things abroad,” said 
2345 The question was not a very clear one, but the colonel never hesitated 
2348 “Sir Stafford always took that view in the House, and consequently 
2352 This was a rather more embarrassing demand than the previous one, and 
2353 the colonel hemmed and coughed, and prepared for a speech of subtle 
2354 generalities; but the dexterity was all unnecessary, for her Ladyship 
2355 had already forgotten the theme, and everything about it, as she went 
2357 there! The Earl, you know, had promised solemnly that he would go any 
2358 lengths for the party when he got his blue riband; and so they took him 
2359 at his word, and actually named him to the viceroyalty. It was a very 
2362 It was exactly like the story of what was that man's name, who assisted 
2363 in the murder of the Emperor Paul Geroboffskoi, or something like that, 
2364 and whose wife followed him to the mines.” 
2366 The colonel avowed that the cases were precisely alike, and now the 
2367 conversation if the word can be degraded to mean that bald disjointed 
2368 chat ran upon London people and events their marriages, their dinners, 
2369 their separations, coalitions, divorces, and departures; on all 
2370 which themes Haggerstone affected a considerable degree of knowledge, 
2373 from the newspapers. It was at the close of a lamentation on the utter 
2375 meant to pass the winter. 
2377 “I wish I knew,” said she, languidly. “The Dollingtons say Naples; the 
2378 Upsleys tell us Rome; and, for my part, I pronounce for neither. Lady 
2379 Dollingtou is my aversion, and the three Upsley girls, with their pink 
2382 “What does your Ladyship think of Florence?” asked the colonel, 
2385 “Pretty much what I might of one of the Tonga Islands. I know nothing of 
2386 the place, the people, or the climate. Pray tell me about it.” 
2389 shoulders; “not but the place might be very agreeable, if there were 
2390 some one of really fashionable standing to take the lead and give a tone 
2391 to the society; some one who would unite indispensable rank and wealth 
2393 assume the first place. Then, I say, Florence would be second to no city 
2394 of Italy. Would that your Ladyship would condescend to accept the vacant 
2397 “I!” said she, affecting astonishment; and then laughingly added: “Oh 
2398 no! I detest mock sovereignty. I actually shudder at the idea of the 
2400 Not the Browns and Smiths and Perkinses; not the full-pensioned East 
2401 Indians, the half-pay colonels, and the no-pay Irish gentilities, that 
2402 form the staple of small city society. You surely would not recommend me 
2407 then with a practised readiness ran over a list of foreign celebrities 
2408 French, Russian, and German whose names, at least, clinked like the true

2420 even before it been more than on the periphery of fashionable society. 
2421 When she did obtain a footing within the charmed circle, it was by no 
2422 prescriptive right, but rather on some ground of patronage, or some 
2424 matter of moment. There was, therefore, a flattery in the thought of 
2426 though there might be little real power, there would be all the tyranny 
2430 her; on the contrary, she compassionated the “poor dear things,” that 
2431 thought themselves “the world,” in such a place, and smiled with angelic 
2432 pity at their sweet simplicity; but Haggerstone saw through all these 
2434 fails to do, where only affectation is the pretence. Adroitly avoiding 
2435 to press the question, he adverted to Baden and its dreary weather; 
2437 everything that was his, even his companionship as a guide to the best 
2438 riding or walking roads, and, like a clever actor, made his exit at the 
2441 Lady Hester looked out of the window, and saw, in the street beneath, 
2442 the saddle-horses of the colonel, which were led up and down by a 
2443 groom in the most accurate of costumes. The nags themselves, too, were 
2445 in the midst of universal barrenness, that brought up memories, some of 
2446 which at least were not devoid of pain, so far as the expression of her 
2453 From these reveries she was aroused by the arrival of a package of books 
2454 and papers from the colonel. They included some of the latest things of 
2455 the day, both French and English, and were exactly the kind of reading 
2457 and busies itself about the people and incidents of one very small 
2459 authoresses; the one as tamely well bred and tiresome as the others were 
2460 warm and impassioned, no bad corroborative evidence, by the way, of 
2461 the French maxim, that the “safety of the Lady Georginas has an immense 
2462 relation to the coldness of the Lord Georges.” There were books of 
2465 operas, wherein the list of the spectators was the only matter of 
2466 interest, and better than these were the last fashions of “Longchamps,” 
2467  the newest bulletins of that great campaign which began in Adam's 
2468 garden, and will endure to the “very crack of doom.” 
2470 Lady Hester's spirits rallied at once from these well-timed stimulants; 
2471 and when the party gathered together before dinner, George and his 
2472 sister were amazed at the happy change in her manner. 
2475 certain colonel, who assumes to be known to your father, but I fancy 
2478 “Haggerstone!” said George, repeating the name twice or thrice. “Is not 
2479 that the name of the man who was always with Arlington, and of whom all 
2480 the stories are told?” 
2482 “As I never heard of Arlington's companion, nor the stories in question, 
2485 “Haggerstone sounds so like the name,” repeated George to himself. 
2489 “I am unwilling to tell a story which, if not justly attributable to the

2519 “Rather prosy, and too military in tone for my taste.”

2530 the world of one's acquaintance is a very necessary duty; but, as my 
2531 father used to say, no one thinks of using a sieve for chaff.” 
2533 “This gentleman is, then, fortunate in his obscurity.” 
2537 the gallant colonel.” 
2539 Sydney scanned over the books and journals on the table, and then 
2540 quietly remarked, “If a man is to be judged of by his associates, these 
2541 do not augur very favorably for the gentleman's taste.” 
2549 already promised unfavorably; nor were any of the party sorry at the 
2557 THERE are two great currents which divide public opinion in the whole 
2558 world, and all mankind may be classed into one or other of these 
2559 wide categories, “the people who praise, and the people who abuse 
2561 Everybody is good, dear, and amiable. All the men are gifted and 
2562 agreeable; all the women fascinating and pretty. An indiscriminate 
2563 shower of laudations falls upon everything or everybody, and the only 
2564 surprise the bearer feels is how a world, so chuck full of excellence, 
2565 can possibly consist with what one reads occasionally in the “Times” and 
2566 the “Chronicle.” 
2568 The second category is the Roland to this Oliver, and embraces those who 
2569 have a good word for nobody, and in whose estimation the globe is one 
2570 great penal settlement, the overseers being neither more nor less than 
2571 the best-conducted among the convicts. The chief business of these 
2573 store their memories with defalcations, frauds, suicides, disreputable 
2574 transactions at play, unfair duels, seductions, and the like, and to be 
2575 always prepared, on the first mention of a name, to connect its owner, 
2576 or his grandmother, with some memorable blot, or some unfortunate event 
2577 of years before. If the everlasting laudations of the one set make 
2578 life too sweet to be wholesome, the eternal disparagement of the other 
2580 whether society suffers more from the exercise of this mock charity on 
2581 the one side, or the practice of universal malevolence on the other. 
2583 Perhaps our readers will feel grateful when we assure them that we are 
2584 not intent upon pushing the investigation further. The consideration 
2587 rather like a page of that celebrated “Livre Noir,” wherein all the 
2588 unexpiated offences of a nation are registered. He knew the family

2595 them as evidences of knowledge of life, rather than what they really 
2597 to many the mere “old soldier,” and nothing more; whereas, if nature had 
2598 given him either fancy or epigrammatic smartness, he would have been set 
2599 down for the incarnation of slander. 
2601 It may seem strange that Lady Hester, who had lived a good deal in the 
2604 kind of indemnity for all they do, by never, on any occasion, stopping 
2605 to criticise their neighbors. This semblance of good nature is a better 
2606 defensive armor than the uninitiated know of, enlisting all loose 
2610 In London, Haggerstone would have at once appeared the very worst 
2611 “ton,” and she would have avoided the acquaintance of a man so unhappily 
2614 as he recounted all the misdeeds of those “dear, dear friends” who had 
2615 made up her own “world.” There was at heart, too, the soothing flattery 
2616 that whispered, “He can say nothing of me; the worst he can hint is, 
2617 that I married a man old enough to be my father, and if I did, I am 
2618 heartily sorry for the mistake.” 
2620 He was shrewd enough soon to detect the family differences that 
2621 prevailed, and to take advantage of them, not by any imprudent or 
2624 would be distasteful to the others, and thus alienate her more and more 
2625 from their companionship. In fact, his great object was to make Lady 
2629 existence. In a great measure it may be traced to the prevailing taste 
2631 respect or even attention, but suffers men to indulge their caprices to 
2632 any extent of selfishness; thus unfitting them for ladies' society, 
2634 themselves, and to talk upon themes and discuss subjects that usually 
2635 are reserved for other audiences. 
2637 Certain clever men liked this liberty, these receptions were a kind of 
2639 in this wide tariff, and so conversation, emancipated from the 
2641 display, that gradually attracted people to these reunions, and made all 
2642 other society appear cold, formal, and hypocritical by contrast. This 
2647 and lastly, it was certain to outrage the “Onslows.” It was a “part” 
2652 With all the vulgar requirements of “Lionism” she was already 
2654 a very tolerable billiard-player, and could row a little. But with the 
2655 higher walks of the craft she had made no acquaintance; she had not 
2658 with the members of this sect. That she could acquire all these 
2659 things rapidly and easily the colonel assured her, and, by way 
2660 of “matriculating,” reminded her of her challenge respecting the 
2661 pistol-shooting, for which he had made every preparation in the garden 
2662 of the hotel. 
2664 True to his word, he had selected a very pretty alley, at the end of 
2666 stray shots. On a table were displayed, in all the dandyism such 
2667 objects are capable of, a handsome case of pistols, with all the varied 
2668 appliances of kid leather for wadding, bullet-moulds, rammers, hammers, 
2669 screws, and rests, even to a russia-leather bound note-book, to record 
2670 the successes, nothing had been forgotten; and Lady Hester surveyed with 
2674 “Only fancy the barbarism of the land we live in,” said he; “I have sent 
2681 believe such is the case.” As he spoke, his servant came up with a small 
2684 “I have got this figure, sir,” said he, “with the greatest difficulty, 
2686 little fellow of the toy-shop parted with it in tears, as if it had been 
2687 his brother.” 
2690 statue of Goethe's “Marguerite,” in the attitude of plucking the petals 
2694 in the Black Forest. Does your Ladyship think you could hit the feather 
2695 of her cap without hurting the head?” 
2697 “I couldn't think of such profanation,” replied she; “there is really 
2698 something very pretty in the attitude and expression. Pray let us 
2701 But the colonel persisted in assuring her that these were the commonest 
2703 rusty knife carved similar figures, and in the midst of his explanations 
2704 he placed the statue upon a little stone pillar about twenty paces off. 
2707 she been convinced that the figure was a valuable work of art, she 
2708 would have felt rather flattered than otherwise at the costliness of the 
2710 had the charm of extravagance at least; but she never gave the colonel 
2711 credit for such gallantry, and the more readily believed all he said on 
2712 the subject. 
2714 Colonel Haggerstone proceeded to load the pistols with all that pomp and 
2717 with emery, were forced down the barrels by a hammer, the hair trigger 
2718 adjusted, and the weapon delivered to Lady Hester with due solemnity. 
2720 “If I go wide of the mark, Colonel, I beg you to remember that I have 
2727 Had not Lady Hester been herself anxious to hide the confusion the 
2728 allusion to the viscount always occasioned her, she could not have 
2729 failed to remark how uncomfortably astonished was Haggerstone at the 
2731 might relieve her embarrassment she pulled the trigger; but the aim was 
2732 an erring one, and no trace of the bullet to be seen. 
2735 pettishly; “I'm certain I was very wide of the mark.” 
2737 “I 'm positive I saw the plaster drop from the wall somewhere 
2738 hereabouts,” said the complaisant Colonel, pointing to a spot close 
2739 beside the figure. “Yes, and the twigs are broken here.” 
2742 should, before I fired; and when one has the anticipation of failure, it 
2743 is so easy to vindicate the impression.” 
2748 her companion's flatteries went for nothing. Meanwhile, he presented the 
2752 “I 'll not try again,” said she, pettishly. “Either the pistols don't 
2753 suit me, or the place or the light is bad. Something is wrong, that's 
2756 Haggerstone bit his lip in silence, and went on reloading the pistols 
2759 the desire to display his own skill, for he was a celebrated shot, and 
2760 not a little vain of the accomplishment. Vanity carried the day at last, 
2761 and taking up the weapon, he raised it slowly to a level with his eye. A 
2764 “I have taken my aim, and now you may give the word for me to fire when 
2765 you please,” said he, turning his eyes from the object, and looking 
2768 She stared at him as if to reassure herself of the direction of his 
2769 glance, and then called out “Fire!” The shot rang out clear and sharp; 
2770 with it arose a shrill cry of agony, and straight before them, at the 
2771 foot of the pillar, lay something which looked like a roll of clothes, 
2773 forward, and to his horror discovered the dwarf, Hans Roeckle, who, with 
2774 his arm broken, lay actually bathed in blood. With his remaining hand he 
2775 clasped the little statue to his bosom, while he muttered to himself the 
2778 While Lady Hester hurried for assistance, Haggerstone bound up the 
2780 command, asked how the accident had befallen. 
2782 A few low muttering sounds were all the dwarf uttered, but he kissed the 
2783 little image with a devotion that seemed like insanity. Meanwhile the 
2785 “It is the little fellow of the toy-shop, sir. I told you with what 
2788 The wild looks and eager expressions of the dwarf, as he clutched the 
2789 image and pressed it to his heart, seemed to warrant the suspicion; and 
2790 Haggerstone thought he could read insanity in every line of the poor 
2791 creature's face. To the crowd that instantaneously gathered around the 
2793 would give no other explanation of the event than that it was a mere 
2794 accident; that he was passing, and received the shot by chance; nothing 
2797 “Is he not mad, or a fool?” asked Haggerstone of the innkeeper. 
2799 “Neither, sir; Hans Roeckle is an old and respected burgher of our town, 
2803 “Ay! ay!” cried two or three of his townsfolk, to whom the landlord 
2804 translated the Colonel's question; “Hans is a kind-hearted fellow, and 
2808 While these and such-like observations were making around him, the 
2810 operation of considerable pain, that the little fellow bore with heroic 
2813 exclamation of “Saved! saved!” came forth from time to time, the 
2814 bystanders deemed it the utterance of gratitude for his own escape with 
2820 hence!” said Hans, impatiently. “Tell the rich 'Englander' that there 
2821 are wounds for which sorrow would be an ample cure, but there are others 
2829 THE remainder of the day after the dwarf's misfortune was passed by Lady 
2830 Hester in a state of feverish irritability. Sorry as she felt for the 
2831 “sad accident,” her own phrase, she was still more grieved for the 
2832 effects it produced upon herself; the jar and worry of excited feelings, 
2833 the uncomfortableness of being anxious about anything or anybody. 
2837 the luckless colonel, the author of the present evil, fell no measured 
2840 arrested his aim; he should have fired in the air, in fact, he ought to 
2841 have done anything but what he did do;” which was to agitate the nerves, 
2842 and irritate the sensibilities, of a fine lady. 
2844 The conduct of the family, too, was the very reverse of soothing. Sir 
2845 Stafford's gout had relapsed on hearing of the event; George Onslow's 
2846 anger was such that he could not trust himself to speak of the 
2847 occurrence; and as for Sydney, though full of sorrow for the dwarf, she 
2848 had not a single sympathy to bestow upon her stepmother. “Were there 
2850 the trouble to ask how she bore up, or express the slightest anxiety for 
2851 the consequences the shock might occasion her. 
2854 untoward were to happen, the very grave question might arise as to 
2855 the guilt of the parties who appeared in arms without a Government 
2856 permission. He reminded her Ladyship that they were not in England, but 
2858 nothing so rigorous as in the penalties on accidents that took their 
2861 As for the wound itself, he informed her that the bullet had “traversed 
2862 the deltoid, but without dividing the brachial artery; and, for the 
2863 present, sympathetic fever and subcutaneous inflammation would be the 
2864 worst consequences.” These tidings were neither very reassuring nor 
2873 “Perfectly true, madam. I was present when the money was returned to the 
2874 man by a young lady, whose attentions to the sufferer saved him the pain 
2880 “Her father chances to be this poor creature's tenant, and many mutual 
2881 acts of kindness have passed between them.” 
2883 “Not even scandal could asperse her motives in the present case,” said 
2884 Lady Hester, with an insolent laugh. “It looked hardly human when they 
2885 lifted it from the ground.” 
2888 sternly, “but I would defy her here, although there is beauty enough 
2890 pointedness there was no mistaking, the doctor left the room. 
2893 each other so rapidly through Lady Hester's mind, that her whole 
2894 attention was now directed to the young lady of whom Grounsell spoke, 
2897 by any call of duty or necessity. No suggestion coming from within, they 
2898 look without themselves for occupation and amusement. Lady Hester was a 
2900 eager to see whether the fashions that became, or the pleasures that 
2901 beguiled, others, might not suit herself. If such a course of existence 
2903 strive against; and they who follow in the track of others' footsteps 
2904 have all the weariness of the road without the cheering excitement of 
2905 the journey. 
2907 If the young lady found pleasure in charity, why should n't she? 
2910 display it. What a pretty version of the good Samaritan modernized 
2911 one might give in a Shetland scarf and a cottage bonnet the very thing 
2913 be made of the dwarf's chamber, crowded with rude peasant faces, all 
2916 The longer she dwelt upon the theme the more fascinating it became. “It 
2919 was her duty to look after this poor creature.” Just so; there never was 
2922 everlastingly declaring against the knaveries and deceptions practised 
2923 on us in life; but if we only took count of the cheats we play off upon 
2924 ourselves, we should find that there are no such impostors as our own 
2930 certain they came not from any fault of hers; and if self-esteem could 
2932 neutral territory between what we think of ourselves and others think of 
2936 To make her visit to the dwarf sufficient of an adventure, it must 
2939 to her room in the evening, and then there would be abundant time to put 
2940 her plan into execution. Even these few precautions against discovery 
2944 Nothing short of the love of adventure and the indulgence of a caprice 
2946 rain fell in torrents, and swooped along the narrow streets in channels 
2947 swollen to the size of rivulets. The river itself, fed by many a 
2948 mountain stream, fell tumbling over the rocks with a deafening roar, 
2949 amid which the crashing branches of the pine-trees were heard at 
2951 if exposed to such a storm when travelling, surrounded with all the 
2953 she wended her way on foot through the darkness and the hurricane, not 
2955 in the notion of her imaginary heroism. 
2959 no means complimentary, to the whims of fine ladies; while Mademoiselle 
2961  would be dearly purchased by the dangers of such an excursion. 
2964 lost sight of her guide altogether. 
2966 “Here, miladi,” grunted out the courier, in evident pain; “I fail to

2981 “Then you must go back to the inn for one; we 'll wait here till you 
2984 A faint shriek from Mademoiselle Celestine expressed all the terror such 
2992 for a light, and we'll take such shelter as this door affords in the 
2996 road back to the “Russie,” since, if truth must be told, he himself had 
2997 extinguished the light, in the hope of forcing Lady Hester to a retreat. 
3002 shivering and storm-beaten beneath the drip of a narrow eave. The spirit 
3004 was wet through, her shoes soaked with rain, and the cold blast that 
3005 swept along seemed as if it would freeze the very blood in her heart. 
3008 repeating the words, “Quelle aventure! quelle aventure!” in every 
3018 None knew better than Lady Hester the significant depreciation of the 
3019 Frenchwoman's phrase, and how differently had she rated all the hazards 
3020 of the enterprise if any compromise of character were to have followed 
3023 “If he should have missed the way, and not be able to find us!” she 
3024 said, after another pause. 
3026 “We shall be found dead in the morning,” cried Celestine; “et pour 
3029 The possibility that her fears suggested, and the increasing severity 
3030 of the storm for now the thunder rolled overhead, and the very ground 
3031 seemed to shake with the reverberation served to alarm Lady Hester, and 
3032 for the first time she became frightened at their situation. 
3034 “We could scarcely find our way back, Celestine!” said she, rather in 
3035 the tone of one asking for comfort than putting a question. 
3039 “And Gregoire says that these houses are all uninhabited.” 
3041 “Quelle aventure!” sobbed the maid. 
3044 that, Ce'lestine? was it lightning? there, don't you see it yonder, 
3045 towards the end of the street? I declare it is Gregoire; I see the 
3048 A cry of joy burst from both together, for already hope had begun to 
3051 Lady Hester tried to call his name, but the clattering noise of the 
3052 storm drowned the weak effort. The light, however, came nearer at 
3053 each instant, and there was no longer any doubt of their rescue, when 
3054 suddenly it turned and disappeared at an angle of the street. Lady 
3055 Hester uttered a piercing cry, and at the instant the lantern was again 
3056 seen, showing that the bearer had heard the sounds. 
3061 Whoever carried the lantern seemed for a moment uncertain how to act, 
3062 for there was no reply, nor any change of position for a few seconds, 
3063 when at length the light was seen approaching where Lady Hester stood. 
3069 our way. Our courier went back to the inn for a lantern, and has never 
3071 to the Hotel de Russie?” 
3074 take shelter there for the present.” 
3079 “Have no fears on that score, mademoiselle,” said the unknown, laughing, 
3083 Few as these words were, there was in their utterance that indescribable 
3085 now replied to her unseen acquaintance with the observance due to an 
3086 equal, and willingly accepted the arm she offered for guidance and 
3089 “At the end of this little street, scarcely two minutes' walking, and 
3090 you will be there,” said the unknown. 
3092 Lady Hester scarcely heard the remark, as she ran on with voluble levity 
3093 on the dangers they had run, the terrific storm, the desertion of 
3094 the courier, her own fortitude, her maid's cowardice, what must have 
3095 happened if they had not been discovered, till at last she bethought her 
3096 of asking by what singular accident the other should have been abroad in 
3100 the doctor's to fetch some medicine for him.” 
3103 pleased with the opportunity of parading her own merits, “to visit a

3108 a door, to which a bell, attached on the inside, gave speedy warning of 
3109 their approach. 
3112 your absence!” And the same moment a young girl appeared with a light, 
3113 which, as she shaded it with her hand, left her unaware of the presence 
3116 “Think rather of this lady, and what she must have suffered,” said Kate, 
3119 “Or rather, what I might have suffered,” interposed Lady Hester, “but 
3120 for the fortunate accident of your coming. A few moments back, as I 
3121 stood shivering beneath the storm, I little thought that I should owe 
3122 my rescue to a countrywoman. May I learn the name of one to whom I am so 
3125 “Dalton, madam,” said Nelly; and then with a slight confusion, added, 
3126 “we ought, perhaps, to tell the circumstances which induced my sister to 
3129 “She knows it all,” broke in Kate, “and can the more readily forgive it, 
3130 as it was her own errand. But will not this lady come near the fire?” 
3131  said she, addressing Mademoiselle Celestiue, who, as she followed the 
3132 rest into the humble chamber, was bestowing a most depreciatory glance 
3133 upon the place, the furniture, and the people. 
3137 her gratitude.” Ellen courtesied respectfully at the announcement, but 
3139 common admiration at the handsome figure of the stranger. An innate 
3141 overjoyed to think that their chance acquaintance should be one of that 
3143 grace and fascination of the high-born, Kate watched with eager and 
3144 delighted looks the slightest gestures, the least traits of manner, of 
3145 the fashionable beauty. They were all attractions to which her heart 
3146 gave a ready response. The accent in which she spoke, the careless 
3147 elegance of her attitude as she lay back in her chair, the charming 
3148 negligence with which she wore the little portions of dress exchanged 
3149 for her own, were all inimitable graces in the eye of the simple girl. 
3151 As for Lady Hester, accustomed to all the servile offices of her own 
3153 sensation to watch the zealous and eager devotion with which the two 
3154 sisters ministered to her wants. In utter forgetfulness of themselves, 
3155 they had brought forth the little resources of their humble wardrobe, 
3156 too happy, as it seemed, when they saw their services so willingly 
3157 accepted. Fortunately, they did not perceive the contemptuous looks 
3158 with which “mademoiselle” regarded their attentions, nor overheard 
3159 her exclamation of “Mon Dieu! where did they gather together these 
3160 chiffons?” as she surveyed the somewhat antiquated stores of their 
3164 of what was so generously offered, the very singularity of the scene 
3168 costume, curiously made up of shreds and patches the most incongruous, 
3169 was the dress of an Irish peasant, and was in an ecstasy at the thought 
3170 of a similar one at her next fancy ball. Besides all these internal 
3171 sources of self-satisfaction, the admiration of the two sisters was 
3172 another and more legitimate cause of pleasure; for even Ellen, with all 
3174 with the charm of those fascinations which, however destined but for one 
3177 Ellen Dalton's life had not been devoid of trials, nor had they failed 
3178 to teach their own peculiar lessons; and yet her experiences had not 
3188 WE left Lady Hester, in our last chapter, employed in the exercise of 
3189 those fascinations which, however unlike in other respects, have this 
3190 resemblance to virtue, that they are assuredly their own reward. The 
3191 charm of courtesy never conferred one half the pleasure on those for 
3193 whether the magician be prince or “charlatan,” the art of pleasing is 
3194 one of the most agreeable faculties human nature can be endowed with. 
3195 Whether Lady Hester was aware of the theory or not, she felt the fact, 
3196 as she saw the undisguised admiration in the faces of the two sisters; 
3197 for while she had won over Nelly by the elevation of her sentiments and 
3198 the kindness of her expressions, Kate was fascinated by her beauty, her 
3202 Without anything that approached the prying of curiosity, for she was 
3204 motive, she inquired by what accident the Daltons remained at Baden so 
3205 late in the season, affected to see some similarity between their cases 
3206 and her own, asked in the most feeling terms for their father, whose 
3207 ill-health she deplored, and then took such an interest in “dear Frank,” 
3210 the handsome youth. 
3212 While thus hearing about them, she was equally communicative about 
3213 herself, and enlisted all the sympathies of the girls as she recounted 
3214 their escape from the torrent in the Black Forest, and their subsequent 
3219 Roeckle and the accident of that morning. 
3221 “Do tell me everything about the poor dear thing,” said she, poutingly. 
3232 “Oh, that, of course,” interrupted she; “they are rarely deficient in 
3233 acuteness, but so spiteful, so full of malice. My dear child, there 's 
3234 no trusting them. They never forget an injury, nor even an imaginary 
3236 Benywowski, I think you remember, they baked him in a pie, to amuse 
3237 Charles II. well, he never forgave it after wards, and to the day of his 
3238 death could never bear the sight of pastry.” 
3245 “Their very caprices, my dear, lead them into all kinds of

3248 to part with them. Now, there 's no saying to what excesses he might 
3249 be carried by this absurd passion. I have read of the most atrocious 
3252 “I assure you, madam, there need be no fear of such in the present 
3253 instance. In the first case, Hans is too good; in the second, the

3258 “Nay, my Lady; nor would you either, were you to regard them with 
3262 the candle. 
3268 regardless of her sister's interruption now exhibited the figure nearer. 
3276 “No, madam; my sister Nelly was the artist of this, as of all the 
3277 others. Unaided and untaught, her own ingenuity alone suggesting the 
3278 means, as her imagination supplied the conception.” 
3281 “You forget how unworthy these poor efforts are of such high-sounding 
3282 epithets.” Then, turning to Lady Hester, she continued: “Were it to ears 
3283 less charitable than yours, madam, these foolish words were spoken, I 
3284 should fear the criticism our presumption would seem to call forth. But 
3287 “But this figure is admirable; the attitude is graceful; the character 
3288 of the head, the features, are in good keeping. I know, of course, 
3289 nothing of the resemblance to your brother, but, as a work of art, I am 
3290 competent to say it has high merit. Do tell me how the thought of doing 
3291 these things first occurred to you.” 
3294 Ellen, with a degree of constraint that seemed as if the question were 
3297 “Yes, and so have I spent months ay, I believe I might say years at the 
3301 “I am happy to think so, madam,” was the low response. 
3305 “That the motive in my case never could have been yours, madam.” 
3307 “And what was the motive?” 
3317 “How very sad how dreadful!” exclaimed Lady Hester. But whether the 
3318 expressions referred to the condition of the Daltons or of Ireland, it 
3321 “I doubt, madam, if I should have ventured on the confession,” said 
3322 Ellen, with a voice of calm firmness, “were it not for the opportunity

3330 and the Maiden. Only he is not in love with you, I hope?” 
3335 “Hush! Hans is awaking,” said Ellen, as on tiptoe she crossed the room 
3336 noiselessly, and opened the door of the chamber where the dwarf lay.

3342 unceasingly, with a low muttering, which he continued, regardless of the

3362 two, he said: “It was in Nuremberg, in the Oden Gasse, it happened. The 
3363 Ritter von Ottocar stabbed her as she knelt at the cross; and the dwarf, 
3364 Der Mohrchen, as they called him, tore off his turban to bind up the

3388 needs in life,” said Kate, while Nelly busied herself in arranging the 
3389 position of the wounded limb, little offices for which the poor dwarf 
3393 along the walls, as if some objects were moving before them!” And so 
3394 in reality was it. Hanserl's looks were riveted upon the strange and 
3395 incongruous assemblage of toys which, either suspended from nails or 
3396 ranged on shelves, decorated the sides of the chamber. “Ay,” said he

3406 and kneel reverently, for the bell is ringing; and here comes the priest 
3407 in his alb, and with the pix before him. Hush! they are chanting his 
3408 requiem. Ah! yes. Hanserl is away to the far-off land,

3416 voices in the outer room at the same moment caught their attention, and 
3417 they heard the courier of Lady Hester in deep converse with Mademoiselle 
3418 Celestine. He, deploring the two hours he had passed in hunting after 
3419 his mistress through the dark streets of the village; and she, not less 
3420 eloquently, bewailing the misery of a night spent in that comfortless 
3425 “Que voulez-vous!” said Monsieur Gregoire, with a shrug of the 
3433 “Do not be rash, mademoiselle,” interposed the courier; “they are rich, 
3434 very rich, and we are going to Italy too, the real pays de Cocagne of

3445 her, until he at last descried a light, the only one that shone from any 
3446 window in the whole village. 
3449 cloaks, and clogs, and as the storm had now passed over, Lady Hester 
3452 did she well know whether most to admire her heroism during the storm, 
3453 or the success with which she captivated the two sisters; the courage 
3454 which planned the expedition, or the grace with which it was executed. 
3457 Remember, Miss Kate Dalton, that they must not deny me to you” said 
3458 she, in her most winning of manners. The two girls gave their promise in

3489 turning to the sisters, she reiterated her hopes of a speedy meeting, 
3490 and with a cordial pressure of the hand to each, wished her last 
3498 LONG before Lady Hester awoke on the following morning every 
3499 circumstance of her visit was known to Grounsell. It was the doctor's 
3501 stirring, and to chat away an hour or so with the invalid, telling 
3502 the current news of the time, and cheering his spirits by those little 
3503 devices which are not among the worst resources of the Materia Medica. 
3506 astonished beyond measure at this step: not that the false air of 
3508 medicine, and had seen far too much of the dark side of human nature, 
3509 to be easily gulled, but his surprise arose from the novelty of her 
3510 condescending to know, and even propitiate, the good graces of people 
3511 whom she usually professed to regard as the least interesting of all 
3513 themselves to Lady Hester's mind by the medium of an occasional 
3515 associated with a subsequent police report, where the object of 
3524 on this theme more than once, “embroidering the sentiment” with an 
3526 had often thought over the difficulty of serving the Daltons with Sir 
3527 Stafford, by reflecting on the hostility any project would meet with 
3532 without power to make the slightest observation; and it was only at the 
3533 end of a lengthy description from the two sisters, that he exclaimed, in 
3537 itself. You should have seen the tender way she took poor Hansells hand 
3538 in her own, and how eagerly she asked us to translate for her the few 
3544 “And with what winning grace she spoke!” cried Kate. “How the least 
3551 “How easy to credit all that one hears of the charms of intercourse, 
3559 “With what inborn courtesy she accepted the little valueless attentions, 
3562 “How beautiful she looked, in all the disorder of a dress so unlike her 
3566 “How delightful it must be to be admitted to the freedom of daily 
3567 intercourse with such a person, to live within the atmosphere of such 
3568 goodness and such refinement!” And thus they went on ringing the changes 
3569 upon every gift and grace, from the genial warmth of her heart, to the 
3572 dropped them all in turn, and gathered them up again, in a perfect fever 
3582 “Pretty much the same, I think,” said he, with a grunt. 
3584 “How delightful! And always in the same buoyancy of spirits?” 
3586 “Very little changed in that respect,” said he, with another grunt. 
3589 his home, and obliged to put up with the miserable resources of a 
3590 watering-place in winter; but I own, when I think of the companionship 
3593 “He needs it all, then,” said Grounsell, as, thrusting his hands into 
3594 the recesses of his pockets, he sat a perfect picture of struggling 
3601 not to divulge to strangers, as were the Daltons, any of the domestic 
3602 circumstances of those with whom he lived, he felt, on the other, 
3606 “She asked the girls to go and see her,” said Dalton, now breaking 
3607 silence for the first time; for although flattered in the main by what 
3608 he heard of the fine lady's manner towards his daughters, he was not 
3609 without misgivings that what they interpreted as courtesy might just as 
3611 and blood most sturdily rebelled. “She asked them to go and see her, and 
3612 it was running in my head if she mio'ht not have heard something of the 
3619 was aunt to some rich city banker; and indeed, to tell the truth, his 
3620 friends in Ireland never thought much of the connection but you see 
3621 times are changed. They are up now, and we are down, the way of the 
3622 world! It 's little I ever thought of claiming relationship with the 
3623 like o' them!” 
3625 “But if it 's they who seek us, papa?” whispered Kate. 
3627 “Ay, that alters the case, my dear; not but I'd as soon excuse the 
3629 in Ireland, we can't entertain them, not even give them a dinner-party.” 
3632 save us the humiliation of being absurd? Why should we think of such a 
3633 thing? Why should we, with our straitened means and the habits narrow 
3638 “We are changed, there's no doubt of it; or it is not a Dalton would say 
3639 the words you 've just said. I never knew before that the best in the 
3642 “When we had a roof,” said Nelly, firmly. “And if these ancestors had 
3644 Had they felt shame to participate in schemes of extravagance and costly 
3645 display, had they withheld encouragement from a ruinous mode of living, 
3648 Dalton seemed thunderstruck at the boldness of a speech so unlike the 
3650 portion of the family calamities to their own misconduct to have 
3651 laid the blame of their downfall to any score save that of English 
3652 legislation, acts of parliament, grand-jury laws, failure of the potato 
3653 crop, tithes, Terry alts, or smut in the wheat was a heresy he never, in 
3654 his gloomiest moments, had imagined, and now he was to hear it from the 
3658 a drop of our blood in your veins at all, or is it the Godfreys you take 
3663 “Papa, dearest, kindest papa!” cried Nelly, as the tears burst from her 
3666 grieve not for myself; in the humble sphere in which I am placed, I have 
3669 them is clearer. If I feel sorrow, it is for you and my dear sister, 
3671 adorn a more exalted station. But for me the lame Nelly, as children 
3673 her father had clasped his arms around her, and Kate, in a gush of 
3676 “Where's the doctor? what's become of him?” said Dalton, as, recovering 
3677 from his emotion, he wished to give a different direction to their 
3681 without saying good-bye, whenever there is a word said about family.” 
3687 Nelly could probably have suggested a better reason for the doctor's 
3688 conduct, but she prudently forbore from again alluding to a theme 
3691 With the reader's permission, we will now follow him as, with a gesture 
3692 of impatience, he abruptly left the room on the very first mention by 
3700 he see that there 's no independence for a man in debt, and no true 
3701 self-respect left for him who can't pay his tailor? For himself there's 
3702 no help; but the poor girls! he'll be the ruin of them. Kate is already 
3704 and poor Nelly's spirits will be broken in the hopeless conflict with 
3705 his folly! Just so, that will be the end of it; he will turn the head of 
3706 one, and break the heart of the other; and yet, all the while, he firmly 
3709 them.” Thus soliloquizing, he went on ringing changes over every form of 
3710 imprudence, waste, vanity, and absurdity, which, by applying to them the 
3712 needed no other explanation. In this mood he made his entrance into 
3713 Sir Stafford's chamber, and so full of his own thoughts that the worthy 
3716 “Eh! Grounsel, what 's the matter, another row with my Lady, eh?” said 
3719 “Not to-day. We 've not met this morning, and, consequently, the 
3722 to arrive at noon without the risk of an apoplexy.” 
3730 given me the whole narrative of that unlucky business. We must take care 
3731 of the poor fellow, Grounsell, and see that he wants for nothing.” 
3733 “You 're thinking of the pistol-shooting; but that 's not her Ladyship's 
3734 last,” said the doctor, with a malicious laugh. “It is as a Lady 
3736 to say with infinite success.” And, without further preface, Grounsell 
3737 related the whole adventure of Lady Hester's visit to the dwarf, 
3739 the reader, and dilating with all his own skill upon the possible 
3740 consequences of the step. “I have told you already about these 
3741 people: of that old fool, the father, with his Irish pride, his Irish 
3743 his head a poor thing in the best of times is gone clean mad about this 
3744 visit. And then the girls! good, dear, affectionate children as they 
3745 are, they 're in a kind of paroxysm of ecstasy about her Ladyship's 
3746 style, her beauty, her dress, the charm of her amiability, the 
3748 henceforth seem a dreary toil; the very offices of their charity 
3749 will lose all the glow of zeal when deprived of that elegance which 
3750 refinement can throw over the veriest trifle. Ay! don't smile at it, the 
3751 fact is a stubborn one. They 'd barter the deepest devotion they ever 
3753 Lady captivated them. Will all the poetry of poor Nelly's heart shut out 
3754 the memory of graces associated with the vanities of fashion? Will all 
3756 the performances of which will henceforth serve to separate her more and 
3759 “You take the matter too seriously to heart, Grounsell,” said Sir 
3763 to be ever on the look-out for results. To Lady Hester, this visit is 
3764 a little episode as easily forgotten as any chance incident of the 
3765 journey. But what an event is it in the simple story of their lives!” 
3767 “Well, well, it cannot be helped now; the thing is done, and there 's 
3769 the matter as you do, for I have been thinking for two days back about 
3770 these Daltons, and of some mode of being of service to them, and this 
3771 very accident may suggest the way. I have been looking over some old 
3773 of course a share in the poor fellow's ruin. Do you know, Grounsell, 
3774 that this is the very same Peter Dalton who once wrote to me the most 
3776 distant relative bequeathed to me a certain estate that more naturally 
3777 should have descended to him. At first, I treated the epistles as 
3778 unworthy of any serious attention, they were scarcely intelligible, 
3780 insult the writer proceeded to menace, I mentioned the affair to my 
3783 of the matter; but now, on looking over some papers, I see that the case 
3784 went hardly with Dalton, for there was a 'rule to show cause,' and an 
3786 the King's Bench, and he was actually imprisoned eight months for this 
3789 hardship to have suffered at the hands of any one man and that one, not 
3793 affairs a hundred times together, and yet he has never even alluded to 
3795 most men; but, assuredly, he is either the most forgetful or the most 
3799 the circumstances of that singular bequest for singular it was from a 
3802 “He remembers it all. It was the last blow fortune dealt him, and, 
3805 difficulty, for many a year, putting off creditors by the plausible plea 
3808 of expenditure that, were he even in possession of the property, it 
3809 would have been impossible to keep up. His brother-in-law's parsimony, 
3811 did, that a considerable sum in Bank stock would be among the benefits 
3813 name, was, then, to know that he was utterly, irretrievably ruined.” 
3815 “Poor fellow!” exclaimed Onslow; “I never suspected the case had been 
3816 so hard a one. His letters you shall see them yourself bore all the 
3817 evidence of a man more touchy on the score of a point of honor than 
3821 brother-in-law against him. He dated his angry epistles from a park or a 
3822 castle I forget which and they bore a seal of armorial pretensions 
3823 such as an archduke might acknowledge. All these signs seemed to me so 
3826 contributed its sting to the injury.” 
3829 with want staring him on every side, he 'd rather talk of his former 
3830 style at confound the barbarous place, I never can remember the name 
3831 of it than he 'd listen to any suggestion for the future benefit of his 
3836 “He reckons the loss at something like six thousand a year,” said 
3839 “Not the half of it, doctor; the estate, when I succeeded to it, was 
3840 in a ruinous condition. A pauper and rebellious tenantry holding their 
3841 tenures on nominal rents, and either living in open defiance of all law, 
3843 better; but if so, it has cost me largely to make them so. Disabuse his 
3847 “Faith, I'll scarcely venture on so very delicate a theme,” said 
3852 something more to the purpose than rectifying a mere mistaken opinion. 
3855 “Ruined gentlemen, like second-hand uniforms, are generally sent to the 
3858 “What if we could get him appointed a magistrate in one of the West 
3861 “New rum would finish him the first rainy season.” 
3865 “About as much as for Lord Chancellor. I tell you the man's pride would 
3869 “An annuity, then, some moderate sum sufficient to support them in 
3870 respectability,” said Onslow; “that is the only thing I see for it, and 
3877 Prichard; he 's coming here this very day about these renewals, and he 
3885 he never troubles his head how the money comes.” 
3890 petulance, generosity, selfishness, liberality, meanness, even to the 
3893 as much the national temperament as that of the individual.” 
3903 NOT even Mademoiselle Celestine herself, nor the two London footmen now 
3904 condemned to exhibit their splendid proportions to the untutored gaze 
3905 of German rustics, could have chafed and fretted under the unhappy 
3908 a species of Palmyra; who lived but for the life that only one capital 
3909 affords; who could not credit the fact that people could ride, dress, 
3910 dine, and drive anywhere else, was lamentably “ill bestowed” among the 
3911 hills and valleys, the winding glens and dense pine forests of a little 
3914 If he liked the excitement of hard exercise, it was when the pleasure 
3916 the animation of a contest, in a rowing-match. Scenery, too, he cared 
3917 for, when it came among the incidents of a deer-stalking day in the 
3919 not distasteful; but to ride, walk, row, or exert himself, for the mere 
3921 to the treadmill, the slavery being voluntary not serving to exalt the 
3924 To a mind thus constituted, the delay at Baden was intolerable. 
3926 domesticity and home life out of the question. She was never much given 
3929 father was too weak to bear much conversation; and as for Grounsell, 
3934 Harold and Werther. Had he been an elderly one, he would have written 
3935 folios by the post, and covered acres of canvas with dogs in worsted, 
3938 smoked away incessantly: sometimes as he lounged out of the window, 
3939 after breakfast, in all the glory of an embroidered velvet cap, and a 
3940 gorgeous dressing-gown; sometimes as he sauntered in the empty saloon, 
3941 or the deserted corridors, in the weed-grown garden, in the dishabille 
3943 lounged along the dreary streets, or passed along the little wooden 
3944 bridge, wondering within himself how much longer a man could resist the 
3945 temptation that suggested a spring over the balustrade into the dark 
3950 now, as he sauntered about the deserted streets of the little village, 
3951 not knowing how long the durance might last, without an occupation, 
3952 without a resource, both his brotherly love and prudence began to 
3953 fail him, and he wished he had remained behind, and taken the chances, 
3954 whatever they might be, of his creditors' forbearance. His moneyed 
3959 had contracted debts, the payment of which must depend upon others; he 
3961 and lost sums totally disproportionate to his fortune; but, in all these 
3962 things, he was still within the pale of honorable conduct, at least, so 
3963 said the code under which he lived, and George believed it. 
3965 Sir Stafford, who only learned about the half of his son's liabilities, 
3966 was thunderstruck at the amount. It was scarcely a year and a half ago 
3967 that he had paid all George's debts, and they were then no trifle; and 
3968 now he saw all the old items revived and magnified, as if there was only 
3969 one beaten road to ruin, and that began at Crocky's, and ended at “the 
3970 Bench.” The very names of the dramatis personae were the same. It 
3971 was Lazarus Levi lent the money, at sixty per cent; it was another 
3972 patriarch, called Gideon Masham, discounted the same. A lucky viscount 
3973 had once more “done the trick” at hazard; and if Cribbiter had not 
3974 broken down in training, why Madame Pompadour had, and so the same 
3978 Nothing is more remarkable in our English code social, than the 
3981 are able to appreciate. Not alone are the gradations of our nobility 
3982 accurately defined, but the same distinctions prevail among the 
3983 “untitled” classes, and even descend to the professional and trading 
3984 ranks; so that the dealer in one commodity shall take the pas of 
3985 another; and he who purveys the glass of port for your dessert, would 
3986 be outraged if classed with him who contributed the Stilton! These 
3988 to them, the presumption is, that they suit us; and I should not have 
3989 stopped now to bestow a passing notice on the system, if it were not 
3991 absurdity, making even of the same career in life a sliding-scale 
3994 by extravagance, he is immediately removed from the Guards, and drafted 
3995 into the Infantry of the Line; if he misbehaves there, they usually 
3997 regiment there; or, in cases of inveterate bad habits, he exchanges into 
3998 the Cape Rifles, and gets his next removal from the knife of a Caffre. 
4001 there is a place between “H--ll and Connaught.” Modern discovery, with 
4002 more certitude, has shown one between the Guards and the Line, a species 
4003 of military purgatory, where, after a due expiation of offences, the 
4004 sinner may return to the paradise of the Household Brigade without ever 
4005 transgressing the Inferno of a marching regiment. This half-way stage is 
4006 the “Rifles.” So long as a young fashionable falls no lower, he is 
4009 exchange into the --th, then quartered in Ireland. It is true he did not 
4010 join his regiment; his father had interest enough somewhere to obtain a 
4015 The “exchange,” and the reasons for which it was effected, were both 
4016 unpleasant subjects of reflection to George; and as he had few others, 
4017 these continued to haunt him, till at last he fancied that every one was 
4018 full of the circumstance, each muttering as he passed, “That 's Onslow, 
4019 that was in the Coldstreams.” Lady Hester, indeed, did not always 
4020 leave the matter purely imaginary, but threw out occasional hints about 
4022 were kept for the wonderment and admiration of foreign sovereigns when 
4024 Berkshire farmer will show a hog, for the delectation of swine fanciers. 
4026 very creditable productions of the kind; but Lady Hester averred, with 
4028 somewhat different career. These currents, coming as they did in season 
4029 and out of season, did not add to the inducements for keeping the house, 
4034 introduced, made the most courteous advances to his intimacy; but George 
4037 either had heard, or fancied he had heard, something about Haggerstone. 
4038 “The Colonel was n't all right,” somehow or other. There was a story 
4040 cautious; and so the young Guardsman, who would have ventured his 
4042 the deliberative wisdom of a judge as to the formation of a passing 
4045 If we have been somewhat prolix in explaining the reasons of the young 
4046 gentleman's solitude, our excuse is, that he had thereby conveyed, not 
4048 character. He was one of a class so large in the world that few people 
4049 could not count some half-dozen, at least, similar amongst their 
4051 if it were not that now and then, every ten years or so, one of these 
4053 weariness, turns out to be either a dashing soldier, with a heart 
4054 to dare, and a head to devise the boldest achievements, or a politic 
4056 the most polished and practised veteran in “the Commons.” 
4058 Our own experiences of our own day show that these are no paradoxical 
4059 speculations. But we must not pursue the theme further; and have only to 
4060 add, that the reader is not to believe that George Onslow formed one of 
4061 these brilliant exceptions. Whether the fault lies more in himself or in 
4064 If his lonely walks did not suggest any pleasant reveries, the post did 
4066 lawyer, every young man about town has his lawyer nowadays, about the 
4067 difficulty of arranging his affairs, being the chief intelligence he 
4073 The viscount's style epistolary was neither so marked by originality, 
4075 as one of his letters bears slightly upon the interests of our story, 
4079 “Oh, Norwood again!” said Onslow, as he looked at the seal, and read the 
4080 not very legible autograph in the corner. “My noble friend does not give 
4082 the paper, and read: 
4084      DEAR ONSLOW, Orson has paid me the two thousand, as you 
4085      ordered, but positively refuses the seventeen hundred and 
4086      eighty, the Ascot affair, because I cannot give up the 
4088      debt. I told him that they were thrown into the fire being 
4089      devilishly tempted to illustrate the process with himself 
4090      six months ago, when you gave the renewals; but all won't 
4091      do, the old prig persists in his demand, to comply with 
4093      the precious ashes of the incremation. I don't doubt but 
4100      opposition to your wishes, as of course he is; that the 
4107      the start as he carries no weight:” which is somewhat of 
4109      with the funds at eighty-two, and a dark horse first 
4110      favorite for the Oaks, is more than I know. Doncaster has 
4111      levanted, and the Red-House folk will smart for it. He would 
4112      back Hayes's lot, and there 's nothing can ever set him 
4113      right again. By the way, Orson hints that if I give him a 
4114      release, or something of that sort, with respect to the 
4115      bills, he 'd pay the cash; but this is only a dodge to make 
4117      won't stand it. Your writing to him will do the whole thing 
4118      at once. What a jolly world it would be, old fellow, if the 
4119      whole race of Orsons were carried off by the cholera, or 
4120      anything akin! They are the greatest enemies to human peace 
4130      I 'll forward the twenty pounds whenever I win the Oaks, or 
4131      marry Miss Home Greville, or any other similar piece of good 
4132      fortune. When he lent me the cash, I don't believe he was 
4133      the owner of as much more in the world; but it suited him to 
4135      knew but all. The chances, therefore, are that he has 
4136      foundered long ago, and you will be spared the trouble of 
4137      the explanation; but if he survive, say something 
4141 Although, unquestionably, the postscript of this elegant epistle was the 
4142 part which reflected most severely upon the writer's good feeling and 
4144 affairs, nor was it till after the lapse of some days that he took 
4145 the trouble of considering the paragraph, or learning the name of the 
4146 individual referred to. Even then all that he could remember was, that 
4147 he had seen or heard the name “somewhere,” and thus, very possibly, 
4148 the whole matter would have glided from his memory, if accident had not 
4149 brought up the recollection. 
4152 that the hotel was closed, the door strongly secured, and all the usual 
4153 precautions of the night taken, in the belief that the inmates were 
4154 already safe within doors. In vain he knocked and thundered at the 
4155 massive panels; the few servants occupied rooms at a distance, and heard 
4156 nothing of the uproar. He shouted, he screamed, he threw gravel against 
4157 the windows, and, in his zeal, smashed them too. All was fruitless; 
4158 nobody stirred, nor could he detect the slightest sign of human presence 
4159 in the vast and dreary-looking building before him. The prospect was 
4160 not a pleasant one, and a December night in the open air was by no means 
4161 desirable; and yet, where should he turn for shelter? The other hotels 
4162 were all closed and deserted, and even of the private houses not one 
4164 admission, he scaled the paling of the garden, and reached the rear of 
4165 the hotel; but here all his efforts proved just as profitless as the 
4167 sight of a faint gleam of light issuing from a small window on the first 
4169 determined to reach the window, to which, fortunately, a large vine, 
4170 attached to the wall, offered an easy access. George was an expert 
4171 climber, and in less than a minute found himself seated on the 
4172 window-sill, and gazing into a room by the aperture between the 
4174 a servant's room. The bare, whitewashed walls; the humble, uncurtained 
4175 bed; three chairs of coarse wood, all strengthened this suspicion, even 
4176 to the table, covered by a coarse table-cloth, and on which stood a meal 
4178 plate of the common brown bread of the country was balanced by a little 
4181 throwing its gloomy gleam over the whole. For a moment or two George was 
4182 unable to detect the owner of this simple repast, as he was engaged in 
4184 the table, spreading his napkin before him, and surveying the board with 
4185 an air of self-satisfaction such as a gourmand might bestow upon the 
4187 gentlemanlike; a little foppish, perhaps, in the arrangement of his 
4188 hair, and somewhat too much display in the jewelled ornaments that 
4189 studded his neckcloth. Even in his attitude, as he sat at the table, 
4190 there was a certain air of studied elegance that formed a curious 
4191 contrast with the miserable meal before him. Helping himself to a 
4193 neither cheers nor inebriates, he proceeded to eat his supper. Onslow 
4195 disposed to laugh at the disparity of the entertainment and him who 
4196 partook of it, there was something in the scene which repressed his 
4202 The piercing cold of the night at length admonished him that 
4203 he should provide for his own admission into the hotel; and although 
4205 natural reluctance at the pain he must occasion to the stranger, 
4207 unceremoniously exposed. “The chances are,” thought George, “that these 
4208 privations are only endurable because they are practised in secret, and 
4209 at no sacrifice of worldly estimation. How can I then or what right have 
4210 I to inflict the torture of an exposure upon this young man, whoever 
4212 acted upon; for he determined to spend the night, if need be, in 
4213 the open air, rather than accept an alternative so painful in its 
4214 consequences. His resolutions had usually not long to await their 
4215 accomplishment; and, turning his back to the window, and disdaining the 
4216 slow process by which he had gained the ascent, he sprang with one leap 
4217 down to the ground: in doing so, however, his elbow struck the window, 
4218 and at the same instant that he reached the earth, the shivered 
4219 fragments of a pane of glass came clattering after him. In a moment the 
4220 sash was thrown open, and a head appeared above. “I have smashed the 
4221 window,” cried George, in French, “as the only means of being heard. 
4222 They have locked me out of the hotel, and I don't fancy spending a 
4223 winter's night in walking the streets of Baden.” 
4225 “You're an Englishman,” said the voice from above, in English. 
4227 “Yes; but I don't see what that has to do with the matter,” replied 
4231 “If you 'll have the goodness to come round to the front door,” said 
4232 the voice, one of the very softest and meekest of voices, “I shall have 
4233 great pleasure in opening it for you.” And at the same time the unknown 
4234 held forth his candle in polite guidance to the other's steps. 
4236 “Thanks, thanks; never mind the light. I know the way perfectly,” said 
4237 George, not a little ashamed at the contrast between his own gruffness 
4238 and the courtesy of the stranger whose window he had broken. 
4240 Onslow had barely time to reach the front door of the inn, when it was 
4244 that the broken pane was not of the slightest inconvenience, that the 
4246 thought, and so forth, he permitted Onslow to escort him to the door of 
4247 his room, and then wished him a good-night. The scene scarcely occupied 
4248 the time we have taken to relate it, and yet in that very short space 
4249 George Onslow had opportunity to see that the unknown had all the easy 
4253 the effect of living abroad, where such a tone usually prevailed. The 
4258 even a thought of him who passed an hour in the effort to repair his 
4259 broken window, and shivered the rest of the night through from the 
4262 Blessed immunity theirs, who so easily forget the pain they occasion 
4263 others, and who deem all things trifles that cost themselves 
4264 no afterthought of regret. Happy the nature that can, without 
4265 self-repining, spill the wine over Aunt Betty's one “peach-colored 
4266 satin,” or, in careless mood, pluck the solitary flower of her only 
4267 geranium. Enviable stoicism that mislays the keepsake of some poor 
4268 widow, or lames the old curate's cob, the fond companion of many 
4269 rambles. These, whatever others think, are very enviable traits, and 
4270 enable the possessors to wear placid countenances, and talk in most 
4271 meritorious strain on the blessings of equanimity and the excellent 
4279 ONSLOW'S first thought, on awaking the next morning, was of last night's 
4280 acquaintance, but all the information he could obtain concerning him was 
4281 that he was an Englishman who had passed the summer in Baden, and during 
4282 the season knew and was known by every one. The waiter called him, in 
4283 the usual formulary, “a very nice gentleman;” and seemed by his manner 
4284 to infer that any further account might be had by paying for it. Onslow, 
4285 if he even understood the hint, was not the man to avail himself of it; 
4286 so he simply ordered him to bring the hotel book, in which the names of 
4287 all travellers are inscribed, and at once discovered that the proprietor 
4288 of the humble entresol, No. 6, was a Mr. Albert Jekyl, with the ordinary 
4290 the same instructive volume, he found that, on his arrival in June, Mr. 
4291 Jekyl had occupied a small apartment on the first floor, from which he 
4292 had subsequently removed to the second; thence to a single room in the 
4293 third story, and finally settled down in the quiet seclusion of the 
4295 materials from which to compile a history, but at least they conveyed 
4296 one inference, and that a very common one, that the height of Mr. 
4297 Jekyl's fortune and that of his dwelling observed to each other an 
4299 then, no very valuable contribution to the gentleman's history was 
4300 contained here, at least the page recorded his name; and George, 
4301 reopening Norwood's letter, satisfied himself that this was the same 
4302 confiding individual who had intrusted the noble viscount with a loan 
4305 he; “another victim of 'trente-et-un.' They have cleared him out at 
4306 the tables, and he is either ashamed to write home, or his friends have 
4307 refused to assist him. And Norwood, too the heartlessness of putting 
4309 this than of fifty other sharp things of the noble Lord's doing, and of 
4310 some of which he had been himself the victim. 
4313 with the tone and air of a man who feels he has said a very generous 
4318 comes of the Continent. If he be really presentable, too, my Lady will 
4320 ungracious message was a bore, to be sure, but then he need not deliver 
4321 it there was no necessity of taking trouble to be disagreeable or, 
4322 better again far better,” thought he, and he burst out laughing at the 
4323 happy notion, “I 'll misunderstand his meaning, and pay the money. 
4328 The more Onslow reflected on it, the more delighted was he with this 
4330 the opportunity of doing a kindness, he was even better pleased at the 
4331 thought of how their acquaintance at the “Grosvenor” and the “Ultras” 
4332  would laugh at the “sharp viscount's being sold.” There was only one man 
4335 of the execution of it, and this he determined should be by letter. A 
4336 short note, conveying Norwood's message and the twenty pounds, would 
4337 save all explanation, and spare Jekyl any unpleasant feeling the 
4340 Onslow's note concluded with his “thanks for Mr. Jekyl's kindness on the 
4344 Within a very few minutes after the billet was despatched, a servant 
4345 announced Mr. Albert Jekyl; and that young gentleman, in the glory of a 
4347 of black velvet embroidered in gold, entered the room. 
4351 jewelled canes, was struck by the costly elegance of his visitor's 
4352 toilette. The opal buttons at his wrists; the single diamond, of great 
4353 size and brilliancy, on his finger; even the massive amber mouthpiece 
4354 of the splendid meerschaum he carried in his hand, were all evidences of 
4355 the most expensive tastes. “Could this by possibility be the man he had 
4356 seen at supper?” was the question he at once asked himself; but there 
4357 was no time to discuss the point, as Jekyl, in a voice almost girlish in 
4366 pleasure, half surprise, for the baronet was the leader of the set 
4367 George belonged to, a man of great fortune, ancient family, the most 
4368 successful on the English Turf, and the envy of every young fellow about 
4373 Onslow could not help a stare at the man who, with perfect coolness 
4374 and such an air of patronage, professed his opinion of the most 
4375 distinguished fashionable of the day. 
4378 could attain to the slightest knowledge of a dinner.” 
4380 Onslow was thunderstruck. Maynard, whose entertainments were the triumph 
4381 of the Clarendon, thus criticised by the man he had seen supping like a 
4384 “Talking of dinners, by the way,” said Jekyl, “what became of 
4390 hand at all the Provencal dishes. Good creature, Merewater. Don't you 
4394  Indeed, the lord in question was reputed as insufferably proud, and as 
4395 rarely admitting a commoner to the honor of his acquaintance. 
4398 does not know who did it. I stole the menu of one of his grand dinners, 
4400 the messes for an emigrant ship, and such a travesty of an entertainment 
4401 never was seen. Merewater affected illness, and went away from the table 
4402 firmly persuaded that the whole was got up to affront him.” 
4404 “I thought the Earl of Bristock lived well and handsomely,” said George. 
4406 “Down at Brentwood it was very well one was in the country and grouse 
4412 The cheese and the decanter of water were uppermost in George's mind, 
4415 of whom he appeared to have lived on the closest terms of intimacy. 
4417 traits and tokens that showed he was speaking with true knowledge of the 
4419 darker topics which form the staple of scandal. A very gentle ridicule 
4421 dress, voice, or manner, was about the extent of Jekyl's criticism, 
4422 which on no occasion betrayed any malice. Even the oddities that he 
4423 portrayed were usually done by some passing bit of mimicry of the 
4424 individual in question. These he threw into the dialogue of his story 
4428 Onslow laughed heartily at many of the imitations, and thus recognized 
4429 characters that were introduced into a narrative without the trouble of 
4430 announcing them. 
4432 “You've heard, perhaps, the series of mishaps which compelled us to take 
4433 refuge here,” said George, leading the way to what he supposed would 
4434 induce an equal degree of communicativeness on the other side. 
4436 “Oh! yes, the landlord told me of your disasters.” 
4438 “After all, I believe the very worst of them was coming to this place in 
4444 “Say, rather, of Nature at her ugliest; for whatever it may be in 
4447 really too dismal. Pray, how do you get through the day?” 
4456 “But why do I ask? there's nothing to shoot. You ride, then?” 
4460 “Cigars will do a great deal; but, confound it, there must be a large 
4461 share of the day very heavy on your hands, even with a reasonable 
4464 “Seldom do either!” said Jekyl, with his usual imperturbed manner. 
4470 not even the usual English resource of a terrier to jump over my stick, 
4471 nor was I early enough initiated into the mystery of brandy-and-water 
4475 “It would be very ungenerous, then, to conceal your secret,” cried 
4476 Onslow; “for assuredly the art of killing time here, without killing 
4482 that the appropriate remedy rises as it were instinctively to his mind, 
4484 the knowledge to a successor. I have, somewhat in the same way, become 
4485 an accomplished idler; and with such success that the dreariest day of 
4486 rain that ever darkened the dirty windows of a village inn, the most 
4487 scorching dog-day that ever emptied the streets of an Italian city, and 
4488 sent all the inhabitants to their siesta, never hipped me. I have spent 
4490 weeks in a calm at sea, with no other inconvenience than the moans of 
4491 my fellow-passengers. There 's no secret in it, Mr. Onslow; or, if there 
4493 habit of throwing ourselves on the resources of somebody else, who, in 
4494 his turn, looks out for another, and so on. Now, a man in a fever never 
4495 dreams of cooling his hand by laying it on another patient's cheek; yet 
4502 began to fear that the sermon on ennui was not unaccompanied by a taste 
4503 of the evil. 
4508 “By the way, who is he?” broke in Onslow, eagerly. 
4510 “He has been traced back to Madras, but the most searching inquiries 
4511 have failed to elicit anything further.” 
4513 “Is he the man they called Arlington's Colonel Haggerstone?” 
4516 more deeply into the subject. 
4518 “And your other companion who is he?” 
4523 in the three kingdoms, and if a little down in the world bad luck to 
4524 them that done it! just as ready as ever he was to enjoy agreeable 
4525 society and the ganial flow of soul.” 
4527 “He 's the better of the two, I take it,” said Onslow. 
4531 penitentiary. There 's another feature also which ought to give him the 
4533 I have passed the windows, and which I conjecture to belong to his 
4536 “Have you not made their acquaintance?” asked Onslow, in some surprise. 
4540 “Why, the matter should not be very difficult, one might opine, in such 
4545 “With such a papa, you were about to say. Well, that is precisely the 
4546 difficulty. Had my excellent friend, Peter, been a native of any other 
4548 but with these dear Irish their very accessibility is a difficulty of no 
4549 common order. Assume an air of deference and respect, and they 'll 
4550 set you down for a cold formalist, with whom they can have nothing in 
4551 common. Try the opposite line, and affect the free and easy, and the 
4557 you, if we attack the fortress as allies? I have a notion we should 
4559 have formed none, nor is there need of any. Let us go out, like the

4563 not make his appearance there to-day, as he has already absented himself 
4569 promised to meet his companion at four o'clock the same evening. As for 
4570 Jekyl, he took a very different view of the whole transaction, for 
4571 he knew that while to him there might be considerable difficulty in 
4572 establishing any footing with the Daltons, the son of the wealthy 
4574 presenting him, thought he, I shall have become the friend of the family 
4576 valuable acquaintances in this manner; and although the poor Daltons 
4577 were very unlikely to figure in the category of profitable friends, 
4578 they would at least afford an agreeable resource against the dulness of 
4579 wintry evenings, and prevent what he himself called the “demoralization” 
4580  of absence from female society. Lastly, the scheme promised to establish 
4582 worth all the others. 
4589 How far were the Daltons from suspecting that they were the subject 
4591 fancying to herself all the fashionable beauties whom Kate would eclipse 
4593 society, Sir Stafford was busily concerting with his lawyer the means 
4594 of effectually benefiting them; and George Onslow for want of better 
4595 speculated, as he smoked, on “the kind of people” they would prove, and 
4596 wondered whether the scheme were worth the light trouble it was to cost 
4597 him. Little did they know of all this, little imagine that outside 
4598 of their humble roof there lived one save “dear Frank” whose thoughts 
4599 included them. “The purple and fine linen” category of this world cannot 
4600 appreciate the force of this want of sympathy! They, whose slightest 
4601 griefs and least afflictions in life are always certain of the 
4602 consolations of friends, and the even more bland solace of a fashionable 
4603 physician whose woes are re-echoed by the “Morning Post,” and whose 
4604 sorrows are mourned in Court Journals cannot frame to themselves the 
4608 be, is light in comparison with the crushing sense of isolation, that 
4612 the sick man, and watching with deep and anxious interest the labored 
4614 utterance of his lips, and the strange fancies they syllabled, 
4615 often exciting him to laughter, only deepened the gravity of their 
4616 countenances, and cast over the glances they interchanged a tinge of 
4624 nor is it good for us to throw on fortune the burden that we each should 
4627 “Don't tell me that there is not such a thing as luck!” replied Dalton, 
4628 in a tone of irritation. “I know well whether there is or no! For 
4630 badly. It was the same whether I did anything on the spur of the moment, 
4635 fondly drew her arm round him, “is it nothing that these reverses have 
4636 found you strong of heart and high of courage to bear them? Over and 
4637 over again have you told me that the great charm of field sports lay in 
4638 the sense of fatigue bravely endured, and peril boldly confronted; 
4639 that, devoid of these, they were unworthy of men. Is there not a greater 
4640 glory, then, in stemming the tide of adverse fortune; and is it not a 
4641 higher victory that carries you triumphant over the real trials of 
4642 life, kind of heart, trustful, and generous, as in the best days of your 
4654 no! the sorrows of this world are more equally distributed than we 
4656 conceals them!” 
4658 Her voice shook, and became weaker as she spoke; and the last few words 
4662 “There's somebody at the door,” whispered Daltou; “see who it is, Kate.” 
4664 Kate arose, and opening the door softly, beheld old Andy; his shrivelled 
4667 “What's the matter, Andy? what is it you want?” said she. 
4669 “Is the master here? Where 's the master?” 
4677 followed him outside of the room. 
4679 “There's one of them again!” said Andy, putting his mouth to Dalton's 
4688 “Didn't I know him the minit I seen him! Ayeh! Ould as I am, my eyes 
4695 Andy put his lips once more to the other's ear, and whispered, “An 
4704 “I seen him!” replied the other, with a grin; “and I locked the door on 
4709 “What for! what for, is it? Oh, murther, murther!” whined the old 
4710 creature, who in this unhappy question thought he read the evidence of 
4713 listen to the terrible word he had uttered without a sign of emotion. 
4715 “I seen the papers with a red string round 'em,” said Andy, as though 
4716 by this incidental trait he might be able to realize all the menaced 
4719 “Sirrah, ye 're an old fool!” said Dalton, angrily; and, jerking the key 
4720 from his trembling fingers, he pushed past him, and ascended the stairs. 
4722 If Dalton's impatience had been excited by the old man's absurd terrors 
4725 partake of old Andy's fear of the dread official of the law. Andy, who, 
4726 forgetting time and place, not knowing that they were in another land, 
4727 where the King's writ never ran, saw in the terrible apparition the 
4730 the banshee with a sudden death, as the sight of an attorney with an 
4734 not so easily effaced. And as the liberated captive is said to tremble 
4735 at the clanking of a chain, so his heart responded to the fear that 
4739 breath. “They 've left me nothing but life, and they can't take that. It 
4740 's not that I 'd care a great deal if they did! Maybe it's more bother 
4741 about them titles; but I'll not trouble my head about them. I sold the 
4742 land, and I spent the money; ay, and what 's more, I spent it at home 
4745 “but, God knows, they 're making new laws every day, and it 's hard to 
4746 say if they 'll let a man have peace or ease in any quarter of the world 
4747 before long. Well, well! there's no use guessing. I have nothing to sell 
4748 nothing to lose; I suppose they don't make it a hanging matter even 
4750 reassuring comfort, he pulled up his cravat, threw back the breast of 
4751 his coat, and prepared to confront the enemy bravely. 
4753 Although Dalton made some noise in unlocking the door, and not less in 
4754 crossing the little passage that led to the sitting-room, his entrance 
4755 was unperceived by the stranger, who was busily engaged in examining a 
4758 drummer-boy read to him the bulletin of a great victory. She had 
4759 destined the work for a present to Frank, and had put forth all her 
4760 genius in its composition. The glowing enthusiasm of the blind veteran, 
4761 his half-opened lips,' his attitude of eagerness as he drank in the 
4762 words, were finely contrasted with the childlike simplicity of the boy, 
4763 more intent, as it seemed, in spelling out the lines than following the

4782 “I 'll take the liberty of asking your name, and the object of this 
4785 “Prichard, sir; of the firm of Prichard and Harding, solicitors, 
4786 Lincoln's Inn Fields,” replied the other, whose voice and manner at once 
4789 “I never heard the names before,” said Dalton, motioning to a chair. The 
4791 on the table, proceeded to untie and arrange them most methodically, and 
4792 with the air of a man too deeply impressed with the importance of his 
4793 occupation to waste a thought upon the astonishment of a bystander. 
4796 Dalton, as he took his seat at the opposite side of the table, trying, 
4804 Dalton put on his spectacles and looked at the document for a few 
4810 ready to stand to it to-day as the hour I wrote it.” 
4812 Mr. Prichard, scarcely noticing the reply, was again deep in his 
4813 researches; but the object of them must be reserved for another chapter. 
4822 satisfaction! No matter how pleasurable the theme, or how full of 
4823 interest at the time, years have made such changes in circumstances, 
4824 have so altered his relations with the world, dispelled illusions here, 
4825 created new prospects there, that the chances are he can feel nothing 
4829 Rare as this pleasure is, we left Mr. Dalton in the fullest enjoyment of 
4831 feature of his face showed the enjoyment it yielded him. 
4835 outlive his fingers? I could n't write now as well as I used then, but 
4836 I can feel just the same. There 's the very words I said.” And with this 
4837 he read, half aloud, from the paper: “'But if you my consent to send 
4838 lawyers and attorneys to the devil, and let the-matter be settled 
4840 and how you like, and take the satisfaction as a full release of every 
4842 made; but I grieve to say it wasn't met in the same spirit.” 
4845 up from the papers before him, “you were doubtless suffering under the 
4846 impression of a wrong at the hands of Sir Stafford Ouslow.” 
4851 “The question ought rather to be, what right had you to attribute that 
4854 “What right is it? All the right in the world. Who got the property? 
4856 talking about? Sure the thing is done and ended, and what more does he 
4862 injustice, and that there is one matter, at least, on which he is bound, 
4865 “Satisfaction, is it?” broke in Dalton, catching at the only word that 
4867 and it 's proud I am to oblige him. Not but there 's people would tell 
4868 you that the time 's gone by, and all that sort of thing; but them was 
4869 never my sentiments. 'Never a bad time for a good deed,' my poor father 
4870 used to say, and you may tell him that I 'll think the better of his 
4871 countrymen to the day of my death, for what he 's going to do now.” 
4873 Prichard laid down the paper he was reading, and stared at the speaker 
4880 “Faith, the kindness is all the other way,” rejoined Dalton, laughing, 
4881 “at least, in this country; for the seconds are just as guilty as the 
4882 principals, and have no fun for their money. But, sure, we can cross 
4883 over to Landau; they tell me it's Barbaria there, over the Rhine.” 
4885 “Bavaria, perhaps?” interposed the other. 
4887 “Yes, that 's what I said. We can be over the frontier in two hours. 
4892 delay, either.” 
4899 hear me out, you 'd have seen that nothing was further from my friend's

4908 “Nothing of the kind.” 
4913 “I hope sincerely, sir, that the word may bear a peaceful

4928 initiative given by the bench itself. 
4931 patience, “that, by a clause of the late Mr. Godfrey's will, the 
4932 suggestion was made to the effect that, if Sir Stafford Onslow should 
4933 deem it fitting and suitable, the testator would not be averse to an 
4935 being settled on Mr. Peter Dalton for the term of his life. This clause 
4936 has now been brought under Sir Stafford's notice for the first time, as 
4937 he never, in fact, saw the will before. The document was lodged in our 
4938 hands; and as certain proceedings, of which the letter you have just 
4947 injunction, the terms of which he reads as more obligatory upon him than

4953 three thousand two hundred will now be at your disposal, together with 
4954 the annuity on your life; and to arrange the payment of these moneys, 
4955 and take measures for their future disbursement, I have the honor to 
4956 present myself before you. As for these letters, they are your own; and 
4957 Sir Stafford, in restoring them, desires to efface all memory of the 
4958 transaction they referred to, and to assure you that, when circumstances

4966 “Exactly, sir; Sir Stafford feels that he is simply carrying out the

4984 matter; and that the mere expression of a desire on Mr. Godfrey's part

4991 I am quite ready to go over the matter again.” 
4994 worse. Explanations, as they call them, always puzzle me more; but if 
4995 you 'd go over the subject to my daughter Nelly, her brain is as clear 
4996 as the Lord Chancellor's. I'll just call her up here; for, to tell you 
4997 the truth, I never see my way right in anything till Nelly makes it out 
5000 Mr. Prichard was probably not grieved at the prospect of a more 
5001 intelligent listener, and readily assented to the proposition, in 
5002 furtherance of which Dalton left the room to seek his daughter. On 
5003 descending to the little chamber where he had left the two girls in 
5004 waiting beside the dwarf's sick-bed, he now discovered that they had 
5005 gone, and that old Andy had replaced them, a change which, to judge from 
5009 “Was machst du hier?” cried he, sternly, to the old man. 
5012 the delusion that it was beside an infant his watch was established, he 
5013 tried to rock the settle-bed like a cradle, and then croned away in a 
5018      For he knew their deceiving 
5021 “Was fur katzen jammer! What for cats' music mak'st thou there?” 
5023 “Where 's the girls, Andy?” whispered Daltou in the old man's ear. 
5027 “Gone where? where did they go?” 
5032 “Will ye tell me where they 're gone, I say?” cried Daiton, angrily. 
5034 “Hushoo! husho!” sang out the old man, as he fancied he was composing 
5035 his charge to sleep; and then made signs to Dalton to be still and not 
5038 With an angry muttering Dalton turned away and left the chamber, totally 
5041 “You're just good company for each other!” said he, sulkily, to himself. 
5042 “But where 's these girls, I wonder?” 
5044 “Oh, papa, I have found you at last!” cried Kate, as, bounding down the 
5054 fever, and his home in the Tyrol, and his mother, and everything, she 
5057 did n't know what to say, papa; for we knew that you and the strange 
5058 gentleman were busy in the sitting-room, and while I was thinking what 
5060 don't care for that in the least,' said she; 'let us shut ourselves 
5062 cried at the same moment she said it; but Nelly said that we had none, 
5063 and invited her upstairs to her bedroom; and there she is now, papa, 
5064 sitting on the little bed, and making Nelly tell her everything about 
5068 as a curtain on the bed, nor a bit of carpet on the floor. What 'll she 
5072 said she envied Nelly so much that lovely view over Eberstein and the 
5078 “Isn't my Lady the least taste in life of a humbug, Kitty?” whispered 
5083 “No harm if she is, darling. I'm sure the pleasantest, ay, and some of 
5084 the worthiest people ever I knew were humbugs, that is, they were always 
5085 doing their best to be agreeable to the company; and if they strained 
5086 their consciences a bit, small blame to them for that same.” 
5091 Kate, as she spoke, had opened the door of the little bedroom, and, 
5092 drawing her arm within her father's, gently led him forward to where 
5093 Lady Hester was seated upon the humble settle. 
5095 “It's a nice place they showed you into, my Lady,” said Dalton, after 
5096 the ceremony of introduction was gone through; “and there was the 
5097 drawing-room, or the library, and the breakfast-parlor, all ready to 
5106 which has given me the privilege of an intimate with my dear young 
5108 the dear little room itself, it is positively charming.” 
5111 n't bigger than that there, and you can see seven baronies out of it 
5112 and a part of three counties, Killikelly's flour-mills, and the town of 
5113 Drumcoolaghan in the distance; not to speak of the Shannon winding for 
5120 to Ballymodereena on one side, and from the chapel at Dooras down to 
5121 Drumcoolaghan, 'twas the Dalton estate.” 
5125 “And why not? Weren't they kings once, or the same as kings? Did n't my 
5126 grandfather, Pearce, hold a court for life and death in his own parlor? 
5127 Them was the happy and the good times, too,” sighed he, plaintively. 
5131 “Ah! there isn't much to boast about. The old families is dying out 
5132 fast, and the properties changing hands. A set of English rogues and 
5133 banker-fellows that made their money in dirty lanes and alleys.” 
5136 brought Dalton to a dead stop, and he pulled up as suddenly as if on the 
5145 confusion. “There 's good and bad everywhere; but I wish to the Lord the 
5146 cotton-spinners would n't come among us, and their steam-engines, and 
5147 their black chimneys, and their big factories; and they say we are not 
5150 A gentle tap at the door which communicated with the sitting-room was 
5153 “Come in!” but, not suffering the interruption to stop the current of 
5155 head appeared at the door. 
5159 the intrusion. 
5162 to step in in the morning, and we 'll talk that little matter over 
5167 at this moment;” and the man of law withdrew, with a most respectful 
5173 “And now, papa, we'll adjourn to the drawing-room,” said Kate, who 
5174 somehow continued to notice a hundred deficiencies in the furniture of a 
5177 Dalton accordingly offered his arm to Lady Hester, who accepted the 
5178 courtesy in all form, and the little party moved into the sitting-room; 
5180 very unlike the triumphant glances of her father and sister. 
5184 on the stiff old sofa, “when I avow that I have come here determined 
5185 to pass the evening with you. I 'm not quite so sure that my dear Miss 
5187 already looks gravely at the prospect of listening to my fiddle-faddle 
5195 in the country; but, you see, we don't generally mix with the people one 
5196 meets abroad; and why should we? God knows who they are. There was chaps 
5197 here last summer at the tables you would n't let into the servants' 
5199 nice steppers as ever you looked at, and a groom behind with a leather 
5201 extending the fingers of his open hand at the side of his head, to 
5203 you think? 'Billy Rogers,' of Muck; his father was in the canal--” 
5205 “In the canal!” exclaimed Lady Hester, in affright. 
5207 “Yes, my Lady; in the Grand Canal, an inspector at forty pounds a year, 
5208 the devil a farthin' more; and if you seen the son here, with two pins 
5211 down the 'Naps' at that thieving game they call 'Red and Black,' 
5212 you'd say he was the Duke of Leinster!” 
5221 cordially concur in the caution you practise.” 
5223 “So I 'm always telling the girls, 'better no company than trumpery!' 
5225 little party of one's own, people whose mothers and fathers had names, 
5226 the real old stock of the land. But to be taken up with every chance 
5227 rapscallion you meet on the cross-roads, to be hand and glove with this, 
5228 that, and the other, them never was my sentiments.” 
5230 It is but justice to confess there was less of hypocrisy in the bland 
5232 for, what between the rapidity of Daiton's utterance, and the peculiar 
5234 one syllable of what he said. Meanwhile the two girls sat silent and 
5235 motionless. Nelly, in all the suffering of shame at the absurdity of her 
5236 father's tone, the vulgarity of an assumption she had fondly hoped years 
5238 admiration of their lovely visitor, of whose graces she never wearied. 
5239 Nor did Lady Hester make any effort to include them in the conversation; 
5244 made the whole incomprehensible; she listened to him with well-feigned 
5245 interest, in his narratives of the Daltons of times long past, of their 
5246 riotous and extravagant living, their lawlessness, and their daring; 
5257 “But what could I do? I was forced to come out here for the education of 
5258 the children bother it for education! but it ruins everybody nowadays. 
5261 pounds four-and-sixpence a beast, and what was the price of a score of

5266 told, they teach too! Then there's French you must learn for talking! 
5272 Dalton; but you would seem fortunate enough to have avoided the error. A 
5275 “'Tis one of Nelly's, sure enough,” said he, looking at the group to 
5276 which she pointed, but feeling even more shame than pride in the avowal. 
5278 The sound of voices a very unusual noise from the door without, now 
5279 broke in upon the conversation, and Andy's cracked treble could be 
5282 “Nelly! Kitty! I say,” cried Dalton, “see what's the matter with that 
5284 be quiet for two minutes together.” 
5286 Kate accordingly hastened to discover the cause of a tumult in which now 
5287 the sound of laughter mingled. 
5289 As we, however, enjoy the prerogative of knowing the facts before they 
5290 could reach her, we may as well inform the reader that Andy, whose 
5291 intelligence seemed to have been preternaturally awakened by the sight 
5292 of an attorney, had been struck by seeing two strangers enter the 
5293 house-door and leisurely ascend the stairs. At such a moment, and with 
5294 his weak brain filled with its latest impression, the old man at once 
5295 set them down as bailiffs come to arrest his master. He hobbled after 
5296 them, therefore, as well as he could, and just reached the landing as 
5297 Mr. Jekyl, with his friend Onslow, had arrived at the door. 
5301 “Anan,” muttered Andy, who, although he heard the question, affected not 
5303 them and the door. 
5306 staring with some astonishment at the old fellow's manoeuvre. 
5310 “Perhaps it 's on the lower story?” asked Onslow. 
5312 “Maybe it is, and maybe it isn't, then!” was the answer. 
5318 hand. “'T is n't the first of yer like I seen!” 
5320 “And what may that be?” asked Onslow, not a little amused by the blended 
5321 silliness and shrewdness of the old man's face. 
5323 “Ay eh! I know yez well,” rejoined he, shaking his head. “Be off, then, 
5324 and don't provoke the house! Away wid yez, before the servants sees ye.” 
5327 companion about the visit, was quite satisfied to amuse himself with old 
5336 feelings; and with a sudden jerk of his hand, he dashed the purse out 
5337 of Jekyl's fingers, and scattered the contents all over the landing and 
5339 all!” And the taunt was so far true that the ground was strewn with 
5340 kreutzers and other copper coins of the very smallest value. 
5342 As for Onslow, the scene was too ludicrous for him any longer to 
5344 relish the absurdity of his mistake, as he called it, having put in his 
5346 gather them up, was suffused with a deeper flush than the mere act of 
5350 “What is the matter, Andy?” asked she, turning to the old man, who 
5351 appeared, by his air and attitude, as if determined to guard the 
5354 “Two spalpeens, that want to take the master; that's what it is,” said 
5360 having planned a day's shooting in the 'Moorg,' have come to request the 
5363 “Oh, the thievin' villains!” muttered Andy; “that's the way they 'll 
5366 Meanwhile Kate, having promised to convey their polite invitation, 
5367 expressed her fears that her father's health might be unequal to the 
5368 exertion. Jekyl immediately took issue upon the point, and hoped, and 
5375 “Is it with me these gentlemen have their business?” said he, angrily, 
5380 Dalton thinking of a little excursion after the woodcocks down the Moorg 
5381 Thai; and I have been indulging the hope that you 'll come along with 
5384 The very hint of an attention, the merest suggestion that bordered on 
5387 generations back. It was a rehabilitation of all the Dal tons of Mount 
5389 invited them to walk in, he half felt himself at home again, doing the 
5393 “Are you serious about the shooting-party?” whispered Onslow to Jekyl, 
5396 “Of course not. It's only a 'Grecian horse,' to get inside the citadel.” 
5403 Lady Hester started at the name, and, rising, at once said, 
5410 “Ought I not to ask the same question of your Ladyship?” said George, 
5419 she surveyed Mr. Jekyl through her glass, and then turned away to finish 
5422 Jekyl was not the man to feel a slight repulse as a defeat; but, at 
5423 the same time, saw that the present was not the moment to risk an 
5426 the two sisters, and, by this act of generosity, entitle himself to 
5427 gratitude on all sides. And, after all, among the smaller martyrdoms 
5429 philanthropy, devotes himself to the “bore” of the party. Honor to him 
5430 who can lead the forlorn hope of this stronghold of weariness. Great be 
5431 his praises who can turn from the seductive smiles of beauty, and the 
5432 soft voices of youth, and only give eye and ear to the tiresome and 
5433 uninteresting. High among the achievements of unobtrusive heroism 
5436 your place beside that deaf old lady in the light auburn wig, or draw 
5438 and tremulous lip bespeak an endless volubility on the score of personal 
5442 where deep! Listen to the wearisome bead-roll of family fortunes, the 
5444 to see, hear the long narratives of past events, garbled, mistaken, and 
5445 misstated, with praise and censure ever misapplied, and then, I say, you 
5447 or blue, they yet demand a moral courage and a perseverance that in 
5453 developed themselves according to the exigency, so that the more 
5454 insufferably tiresome his companion, the more seemingly attentive 
5456 “bore-ometer,” in which, from the liveliness of the expression, you 
5457 might calculate the stupidity of the tormentor; and the mercury of his 
5460 for hours long, how Irish gentlemen were ruined and their fortunes 
5461 squandered. What jolly times they were when men resisted the law and 
5462 never feared a debt! Not that, while devouring all the “rapparee” 
5463  experiences of the father, he had no eye for the daughters, and did not 
5466 unbought admiration, and delighted with the wondering homage of the 
5467 artless girl. He watched Onslow, too, turn from the inanimate charms 
5468 of Nelly's sculptured figures, to gaze upon the long dark lashes and 
5469 brilliant complexion of her sister. He saw all the little comedy that 
5471 to arrange a tea-table, and, for the first time since their arrival, 
5473 placed on a marble table for show, constitutes the invariable decoration 
5475 the room, giving Andy her directions a dozen times over, how he was to 
5476 procure the tea, and the sugar, and the milk, extravagances she did not 
5478 his own inferences, not alone of their poverty, but of their unfitness 
5481 “And yet, I'd wager these people,” said he to himself, “are revelling in 
5482 superfluities; at least, as compared to me! But, so it is, the rock that 
5483 one man ties round his neck, another would make a stepping-stone of!” 
5484  This satisfactory conclusion gave additional sweetness to the bland 
5486 pronounced the beverage the very best he had ever tasted out of Moscow. 
5487 And so we must leave the party. 
5495  said Sir Stafford, as, on the day following the events we have just 
5498 “By the end of the week, if the weather only continue fine, we may be on 
5499 the road again.” 
5503 isolation, instead of drawing the members of my family more closely 
5504 together, has but served to widen the breach between them. Lady Hester 
5505 and Sydney rarely meet; George sees neither of them, and rarely comes 
5506 near me, so that the sooner we go hence the better for all of us.” 
5511 but I foresee that, if I consent, the difference between Lady Hester and 
5512 her will then become an irreconcilable quarrel. You don't agree with me, 
5515 “I do not. I never knew the ends of a fractured bone unite by grating 
5516 them eternally against each other.” 
5518 “And, as for George, the lounging habits of his service and cigars have 
5519 steeped him in an indolence from which there is no emerging. I scarcely 
5533 the doctor, solemnly. 
5545 almost black in the angry expression of the moment. 
5551 impugn it. The quality I mean is of a very different order. It is the 
5552 daring to do a thing badly to-day in the certain confidence that you, 
5555 return every morning to the attack; he has not pluck to be bullied 
5556 by mediocrity in the sure and certain confidence that he will live to 
5557 surpass it; in a word, he has not that pluck which resists the dictation 
5560 “I confess I cannot see that in the station he is likely to occupy such 
5565 twentieth of the amount, may be a precious bad judge of the requisites 
5567 the phrenologists call 'Combativeness' is the best in the whole skull.” 
5570 native prejudices to you,” said Onslow, smiling; “and, by the way, when 
5573 “I went to call there last night, but I found a tea-party, and did n't 
5574 go in. Only think of these people, with beggary staring them on every

5583 over this morning to complete the business; so that I trust, when we 
5584 leave Baden, these worthy people will be m the enjoyment of easier 
5587 “I see him crossing over the street now. I'll leave you together.” 
5594 Mr. Prichard's knock was now heard at the door, and next moment 
5595 he entered. His pale countenance was slightly flushed, and in the 
5600 as he seated himself, and threw a heavy roll of paper on the table 
5603 As Sir Stafford did not break the pause that followed these words, 
5610 he reposes much confidence. If I was not impressed with the difficulty 
5612 on meeting with the young lady this morning. A very quietly mannered, 
5614 time must have been actual beauty, was seated alone in the drawing-room 
5617 I mention all these matters with a certain prolixity, because they bear 
5621 apology for her presence there, occasioned, as she said, by her father's 
5624 statement in the most simple and intelligible form, divested so far as 
5629 much from her father's daughter; but I acquiesced and went on. As we 
5630 concocted the whole plot together here, Sir Stafford, it is needless 
5632 I omitted nothing of plausibility, either in proof of the bequest, or in 
5633 the description of the feeling that prompted its fulfilment. I descanted 
5634 upon the happy event which, in the course of what seemed an accident, 
5635 had brought the two families together, and prefaced their business 
5636 intercourse by a friendship. I adverted to the good influence increased 
5637 comforts would exercise upon her father's health. I spoke of her sister 
5638 and her brother in the fuller enjoyment of all that became their name 
5639 and birth. She heard me to the very end with deep attention, never once 
5642 “At last, when I had concluded, she said, 'This, then, is a bequest?' 
5646 “'In that case,' said she, 'the terms on which it is conveyed will solve 
5647 all the difficulty of our position. If my uncle Godfrey intended this 
5651 to the good pleasure of a third party, the matter will have a different 
5652 aspect. Which is the truth?' 
5655 for, and she at once asked to see the will. Disconcerted still more, I 
5656 now prevaricated, stating that I had not brought the document with 
5658 sufficient; and finally assured her that acceptance of the bequest 
5659 involved neither a condition nor a pledge. 
5662 us learn if such be the case.' 
5671 “Seeing it was useless to dwell longer on this part of the subject, I 
5672 adverted to her father's increasing age, his breaking health, and the 
5678 bestow happiness. It is true, as you say, that my dear father might 
5680 but with what changed hearts would not his children minister them 
5684 fortunes have linked us closer together; the storms of the world have 
5685 made us draw nearer to each other, have given us one heart, hope, 
5686 and love alike. Leave us, then, to struggle on, nor cast the gloom of 
5687 dependence over days that all the ills of poverty could not darken. We 
5690 “I tried to turn her thoughts upon her brother, but she quickly stopped 
5693 “'Frank is a soldier; the rewards in his career are never withheld from 
5694 the deserving; at all events, wealth would be unsuitable to him. He 
5695 never knew but narrow fortunes, and the spirit that becomes a more 
5696 exalted condition is not the growth of a day.' 
5699 whether your aid and influence might not avail them in any future plans 
5700 of life they might form? 
5702 “'We have no plans,” said she, simply; 'or, rather, we have had so many 
5703 that they all resolve themselves into mere castle-building. My 
5704 dear father longs for Ireland again, for home as he still calls it, 
5705 forgetting that we have no longer a home there. He fancies warm-hearted 
5706 friends and neighbors, an affectionate people, attached to the very 
5709 still live, that other influences, other fortunes, other names, have 
5710 replaced ours; we should go back there as strangers, and without even 
5711 the stranger's claim to kind acceptance. Then, we had thought of the new 
5712 world beyond seas; but these are the lauds of the young, the ardent, and 
5713 the enterprising, high in hope and resolute of heart; and so, at last, 
5716 there to live for each other; and we are happy, so happy that, save the 
5722 charged her with pride as the reason of refusal. Then suddenly her 
5728 mere haughtiness, I know not the feeling. Our pride is not in our 
5730 others; but in this, that low in lot, and humble in means, we have kept, 
5731 and hope still to keep, the motives and principles that guided us in 
5735 without any of the gifts or graces which attract, we have drawn towards 
5736 us this instance of noble generosity of which you are now the messenger. 
5737 I am not ashamed to own pride in all these.' 
5739 “To press her further was useless; and only asking, that if by any 
5741 resolve, she would still consider the proposition as open to her 
5747 sought to confer a benefit you discover a spirit greater than all the 
5755 “Rather thank God that in this age of money-seeking and gold-hunting 
5756 there lives one whose heart is uncorrupted and incorruptible,” cried 
5761 “Of course not, sir,” chimed in Grounsell, bluntly. “Yours is not the 
5769 legacy to a spendthrift brother; a childless widow that denies herself 
5770 the humblest means of comfort to help the ruined brother of her lost 
5771 husband; a wife who places in a reckless husband's hand the last 
5772 little remnant of fortune that was hoarded against the day of utter 
5773 destitution; and they are always women who do these things, saving, 
5775 economies. Not like your generous men, as the world calls them, whose 
5776 free-heartedness is nothing but selfishness, whose liberality is the 
5779 when you are needy. To draw the rags of poverty closer, to make their 
5780 folds drape decently, and hide the penury within, that is the victory, 
5788 For an instant the pause which ensued was unbroken, when a tap was 
5789 heard at the door. It was a message from Lady Hester, requesting, if Sir 
5792 “You're not going, Grounsell?” cried Sir Stafford, as he saw the doctor 
5793 seize his hat; but he hastened out of the room without speaking, while 
5794 the lawyer, gathering up his papers, prepared to follow him. 
5797 hope of joining the party myself to-day.” 
5801 And now the old baronet sat down to ponder in his mind the reasons for 
5802 so strange an event as a visit in the forenoon from Lady Hester. “What 
5803 can it mean? She can't want money,” thought he; “'t is but the other 
5805 again? Are there any new disagreements at work?” This last thought 
5807 whose narrow fortunes had drawn them nearer to each other, rendering 
5808 them more tolerant and more attached, while in his own family, where 
5812 serious-looking footman entered the room, rolling before him an 
5813 armchair. Another and not less dignified functionary followed, with 
5819 Sir Stafford was contemplating these august demonstrations, when the 
5821 second's pause, she swept into the room in all that gauzy amplitude of 
5822 costume that gives to the wearer a seeming necessity of inhabiting the 
5826 had not the least notion how far this room was off; if Clements has not 
5827 been taking me a tour of the whole house.” 
5830 the cushions, blandly assured her Ladyship that they had come by the 
5833 “I'm sorry for it,” said she, peevishly, “for I shall have the more 
5836 will do; you may leave the room. Sir Stafford, would you be good enough 
5837 to draw that blind a little lower? the sun is directly in my eyes. Dear 
5838 me, how yellow you are! or is it the light in this horrid room? Am I so 
5841 “On the contrary,” said he, smiling, “I should pronounce you in the most 
5846 than the habit of estimating one's sufferings by the very efforts made 
5847 to suppress them.” 
5851 “I am quite sure of that; nor is it my habit to afflict others with 
5853 to acknowledge their existence. How I do hate that man! and I know, 
5856 vulgarly persists in calling you, as much as the others.” 
5861 Not that, for my own part, I have the least objection to any amount of 
5862 detestation with which he may honor me; it is the tribute the low and 
5863 obscure invariably render the well-born, and I am quite ready to accept 
5864 it; but I own it is a little hard that I must submit to the infliction 
5868 and that what you regard as disrespect to yourself is the roughness of 
5870 him and me since we were boys together ought not to be snapped for the 
5872 him for the good qualities he unquestionably possesses, at least bear 
5875 “So I should, so I strive to do; but the evil does not end there; he 
5876 inspires everybody with the same habits of disrespect and indifference. 
5883 relates to my happiness! Well, I remarked it, and saw the supercilious 
5884 smile he assumed when I told him that the pillow was wrong. He looked 
5890 “Even Prichard, that formerly was the most diffident of men, is now 
5893 dinner. The anachronism was bad enough, but only fancy the liberty!” 
5898 “I affected not to hear, hoping he would not expose himself before the 
5899 servants by a repetition of the request. But he went on, 'Will your 
5900 Ladyship' I assure you he said that 'will your Ladyship do me the honor 
5902 notice of his speech. Would you believe it? he returned to the charge 
5904 the liberty' I could n't hear more; so I turned to George, and said, 
5911 “You never think of saying, 'Poor Hester, these are not the associates 
5913 to all these if my own family treated me with proper deference. As 
5914 for Sydney and George, however, they have actually coventried me; and 
5918 of years and certain differences, the fruits of early prejudices and 
5919 habits, would be the only drawbacks on my happiness; but I have lived to 
5926 the first time displaying any trait of animation in her features. “You 
5929 to remember it, 'their ideas are not our ideas; they have not the same 
5930 hopes, ambitions, or objects that we have; their very morality is not 
5936 “Of the City, generally,” replied Lady Hester, proudly. 
5938 “Not in ignorance, either,” rejoined Sir Stafford; “her own father was a 
5941 “But the family are of the best blood in Lancashire, Sir Stafford.” 
5944 had danced to warm his feet on the very steps of the door in Grosvenor 
5945 Square which afterwards acknowledged him as the master; and as he owed 
5947 none heard the speech without thinking the better of him.” 
5950 I have little doubt that the worthy man was merely embellishing an 
5951 incident to suit the tastes of his company.” 
5953 “It was the company around his table, as Lord Mayor of London!” 
5959 Although the appeal was palpably directed to Sir Stafford, he sat silent 
5960 and motionless, patiently awaiting the moment when recollection might 
5964 you will not assist me in the least.” 
5971 “Of Prichard, perhaps?” he said, with a half-sly twinkle of the eye. 
5977 “Pray do not call him my friend. I know very little of the gentleman; I 
5984 “Oh, I have it!” said she, suddenly; the allusion to Hans at once 
5985 recalling the Daltons, and bringing to mind the circumstances she 
5986 desired to remember. “It was exactly of these poor people I came to 
5987 speak. You must know, Sir Stafford, that I have made the acquaintance 
5988 of a most interesting family here, a father and two daughters named 
5993 “Of course, then, every step I have taken in this intimacy has been 
5994 represented in the most odious light. The amiable doctor will have, 
5995 doubtless, imputed to me the least worthy motives for knowing persons in 
5996 their station?” 
5998 “On the contrary, Hester. If he expressed any qualification to the 
5999 circumstance, it was in the form of a fear lest the charms of your 
6000 society and the graces of your manner might indispose them to return 
6001 with patience to the dull round of their daily privations.” 
6004 would be, then, the best antidote he could advise them! But, really, 
6006 my nerves, and irritate my feelings for the whole day after. I want to 
6007 interest you about these Daltons.” 
6009 “Nothing more easy, my dear, since I already know something about them.” 
6015 favorable light; and it was but the very moment I received your message 
6016 I was learning from Prichard the failure of an effort I had made to 
6021 “Yes, yes; I see it all. There was a little love in the business, an old 
6023 and misconstructions to any extent. Dear me, and that was the reason 
6025 more amused at the absurdity of this imputation, or stung by the cool 
6026 indifference with which she uttered it; nor was it easy to know how the 
6029 of an amourette of the past century. You are very fortunate to have so 
6034 not even the shadow of a color. I never even saw Mrs. Dalton; never have 
6038 “Oh, I know the whole business, now! It was at your suit that dreadful 
6039 mortgage was foreclosed, and these dear people were driven away from 
6040 their ancient seat of Mount Dalton. I 'm sure I 've heard the story at 
6042 with it. I do assure you, Sir Stafford, that they have never dropped the 
6046 hold a mortgage over this property; still less exercised the severe 
6050 the trustee, under a will, of a small annuity on his life. He has 
6054 “Poor they must be, certainly. The house is wretchedly furnished, and 
6055 the girls wear such clothes as I never saw before; not that they are 
6056 even the worn and faded finery of better days, but actually the coarse 
6057 stuffs such as the peasants wear!” 
6061 “Not even an edging of cheap lace round their collars; not a bow of 
6062 ribbon; not an ornament of the humblest kind about them.” 
6066 “The younger, beautiful! the deepest blue eyes in the world, with long 
6067 fringed lashes, and the most perfect mouth you can imagine. The elder 
6070 have begun in infancy; one of those dreadful things they call 'spine.' 
6071 Like all persons in her condition, she is monstrously clever; carves the 
6075 spirits like her sister. Kate, the younger girl, is my favorite; a fine, 
6079 If Sir Stafford did not smile at the undue emphasis laid upon the last 
6080 few words, it was not that he had not read their full significance. 
6084 “Like nothing I ever met before; the oddest mixture of right sentiments 
6086 the most refined consideration, and the most utter disregard for other 
6087 people and their feelings, that ever existed. You never can guess what 
6088 will be his sentiments at any moment, or on any subject, except on the 
6096 “I 'm certain he was always the same; at least, it would be impossible 
6106 “Of course not; a kind of humble friend what they call a 'companion' in 
6107 the newspapers to have always with one. She is exactly the creature 
6108 to dissipate low spirits and banish ennui, and, with the advantages of 
6114 ballads that are now getting into fashion. In fact, it is the tone 
6115 of society that mannerism of the world she is deficient in more than 
6119 Hester; but I see some very great objections to the whole scheme, and 
6121 regard the young lady herself. Would it be a kindness to withdraw her 
6122 from the sphere wherein she is happy and contented, to mingle for a 
6123 season or so in another and very different rank, contracting new habits 
6132 Stafford, dubiously. “We ought to look every contingency in the face in 
6135 “I have given the subject the very deepest consideration,” replied Lady 
6136 Hester, authoritatively. “I have turned the question over and over in 
6137 my mind, and have not seen a single difficulty for which there is not an 
6142 “I have done so already. She is charmed with the project. She sees, 
6147 “How would the family receive such a proposition? They seem to be very 
6148 proud. Is it likely that they would listen to a project of this nature?” 
6150 “There lies the only difficulty; nor need it be an insuperable one, if 
6152 if we merely invite her to accompany us, they will naturally enough 
6154 outlay in dress and ornament, quite impossible in their circumstances. 
6155 This must be a matter of diplomacy, of which the first step is, however, 
6160 “Simply, that I have already, but in the deepest confidence, hinted the 
6161 possibility of the project to Kate Dalton, and she is wild with delight 
6162 at the bare thought of it. The dear child! with what rapture she heard 
6163 me speak of the balls, and fetes, and theatres of the great world! 
6164 of the thousand fascinations society has in store for all who have a 
6165 rightful claim to its homage, the tribute rendered to beauty, greater 
6166 than that conceded to rank or genius itself! I told her of all these, 
6170 though to say, “This last was the coup de grace.” 
6172 “So far, then, as Kate is concerned, she will be a willing ally; nor do 
6177 Lady Hester, who at the opening of the interview had spoken with all the 
6181 of gainsay. Some experience had taught him the impolicy of absolute 
6183 eventualities, which, whether the campaign be civil, military, or 
6184 conjugal, is not without a certain degree of merit. In the present case 
6185 there were several escape-valves. The Daltons were three in number, 
6186 and should be unanimous. All the difficulties of the plan should be 
6187 arranged, not alone to their perfect satisfaction, but without a wound 
6188 to their delicacy. Grounsell was certain to be a determined opponent to 
6189 the measure, and would, of course, be consulted upon it. And, lastly, 
6191 no means certain to wish for it the day after she had conquered all 
6199 “How do you propose to open the campaign, Hester?” asked he, after a 
6202 “I have arranged it all,” said she, with animation. “We must visit the 
6203 Daltons together, or better still you shall go alone. No, no; a letter 
6204 will be the right thing, a very carefully written letter, that shall 
6205 refute by anticipation every possible objection to the plan, and show 
6206 the Daltons the enormous advantages they must derive from it.” 
6211 “Enormous they certainly will be!” exclaimed she. “First of all, Kate, 
6213 to benefit the others, who, poor things, can do nothing for themselves.” 
6215 “Very true, my dear, very true. You see all these things far more 
6218 “I have thought so long and so much about it, I suppose there are few 
6219 contingencies of the case have escaped me; and now that I learn how you 
6220 once knew and were attached to the poor girl's mother--” 
6225 “Oh, you did say so! I forget all about it. Well, there was something or 
6226 other that brought the families in relation, no matter what, and it must 
6227 be a great satisfaction to you to see the breach restored, and through 
6228 my intervention, too; for I must needs say, Sir Stafford, there are 
6230 occupied the first place in their husband's esteem.” 
6240 cannot be the arbiters of our affections any more than of our 
6242 attachments.” Here her Ladyship, who had unwittingly glided from the 
6246 regain the lost clew to her discourse she could falteringly say, “Don't 
6253 now for this letter; I conclude the sooner it be done the better. When 
6256 “Grounsell tells me, by Friday or Saturday next I shall be able for the 
6265 “On the contrary, Dr. Clarus assured me there is nothing in the world so 
6266 very deceptive; that pain is only referred to the diseased part by the 
6267 brain, and has no existence whatever, and that there is no such thing as 
6268 pain at all. He explained it perfectly, and I understood it all at the 
6270 the nature of their malady, that it really becomes quite interesting to 
6271 be ill under his care. I remember when William, the footman, broke his 
6274 grate the fractured ends of the bone together.” 
6276 “And was William convinced of the no-pain doctrine?” cried Sir Stafford, 
6280 but Clarus said it would take at least two centuries to conquer the 
6281 prejudices of the common people.” 
6283 “Not improbable, either!” said Sir Stafford. 
6286 six!” And with a graceful motion of the hand, she said, “By-by!” and 
6287 left the room. 
6294 HAS the observant reader ever remarked a couple of persons parading the 
6296 with the same short jerk, to resume the same short path, and yet 
6297 never interchanging a word, the rhythm of the footfall the only tie of 
6298 companionship between them? They halt occasionally, too, to look over 
6299 the bulwarks at some white sail far away, or some cloud-bank rising from 
6300 the horizon; mayhap they linger to watch the rolling porpoises as they 
6301 pass, or the swift nautilus as he glides along; but yet never a sound 
6302 nor token of mutual intelligence escapes them. It is enough that they 
6303 live surrounded by the same influences, breathe the same air, and step 
6304 in the same time; they have their separate thoughts, wide, perhaps, as 
6305 the poles asunder, and yet by some strange magnetism they feel there is 
6306 a kind of sociality in their speechless intercourse. 
6309 took their accustomed walk in the dreary dining-room of the “Hotel de 
6311 met them there, a drifting rain, mingled with sleet, beat against the 
6312 windows, and the wind, in mournful cadences, sighed along the dreary and 
6314 A chance glance through the window, an occasional halt to listen when 
6315 the thunder rolled louder and nearer, showed that, to a certain extent, 
6316 the same emotions were common to each; but nothing else betrayed any 
6317 community of sentiment between them, as they paced the room from end to 
6322 firmly on his head. “But who ever saw the like of this in England?” 
6324 “In England you have weather, but no climate!” said Jekyl, with one 
6328 “It's not the worst thing we have there, sir, I promise you,” rejoined 
6333 “I do not speak of them, sir; I allude to our insolent, overbearing 
6334 aristocracy, who, sprung from the people as they are, recruited from the 
6335 ranks of trade or law, look down upon the really ancient blood of the 
6336 land, the untitled nobility. Who are they, sir, that treat us thus? The 
6337 fortunate speculator, who has amassed a million; the Attorney-General, 
6340 may stand in the 'Gazette' to-morrow or next day as Baron or Viscount, 
6341 without one single requirement of the station, save his money.” 
6348 blood suffice for all my ambitions; but I boil over when I see the 
6349 overweening presumption of these new people.” 
6352 carriage, have the best chance of lasting. Old and worn out are very 
6356 service with the family upstairs, but are quite thrown away upon such a 
6373 “Can't say,” was the short reply. 
6375 “Just the sort of people for Italy. The fashionables of what the Chinese 
6378 “Very pleasant places they are, too,” said Jekyl, with a smile. “The 
6381 Haggerstone gave a short “Ha!” at the heresy of this speech, but made no 
6382 other comment on it. 
6391 “Perhaps not, if she were to consult me on the matter,” said Jekyl, 
6392 blandly; “but as this is, to say the least, not very probable, I may own 
6393 that I like the mixed marriages well enough.” 
6399 “The Onslows are scarcely the people to succeed in that way,” rejoined 
6401 any power to wander from the theme. “Mere money, nothing but money to 
6402 guide them.” 
6404 “Not a bad pilot, either, as times go.” 
6406 Haggerstone uttered another short, “Ha!” as though to enter a protest 
6407 against the sentiment without the trouble of a refutation. He had 
6409 the banker's family, or even obtain from that excessively cautious young 
6410 gentleman the slightest approach to an opinion about them; and yet it 
6412 walk that evening. It was in the hope that Jekyl might afford him some 
6413 clew to these people's thoughts, or habits, or their intentions for the 
6414 coming winter, that he had promenaded for the last hour and a half. 
6415 “If he know anything of them,” thought Haggerstone, “he will be but too 
6416 proud to show it, and display the intimacy to its fullest extent!” 
6418 It was, then, to his utter discomfiture, he learned that Jekyl had 
6420 Onslow. It was, then, pure invention of the waiter to say that they were 
6425 whether it were worth while to risk a bottle of Burgundy in such a 
6426 cause; for often does it happen that the fluid thrown down the pump is 
6427 utterly wasted, and that it is vain to moisten the sucker, if the well 
6430 To be, or not to be? was then the eventful point he deliberated with 
6432 one of those vulgarly minded folk who ask you, in a parenthesis, to come 
6433 in to “manger la soupe,” as they say, without more preparation than the 
6434 spreading of your napkin. No; he knew all the importance of a 
6436 distinguished perfectly between the fare to set before an “habitual 
6440 “Chablis” on the man who would have been contented with “Barsac.” 
6442 The difficulty was not, then, how to have treated Jekyl, but whether to 
6443 treat him at all. Indeed, the little dinner itself had been all planned 
6444 and arranged that morning; and the “trout” from the “Murg,” and the 
6445 grouse from Eberstein, had been “pricked off,” in the bill of fare, for 
6447 about the dish of whole truffles with butter, in the fair intention of 
6448 inviting Mr. Albert Jekyl to partake of them. 
6450 If a lady reveals some latent desire of conquest in the coquetry of her 
6451 costume and the more than ordinary care of her appearance, so your 
6453 liberality by the studious propriety of his petit diner. Never fall into 
6454 the vulgar error that such things are mere accident. As well ascribe 
6455 to chance the rotations of the seasons, or the motions of the heavenly 
6457 asparagus at Christmas, show a solicitude to please to the full as 
6458 ardent, and not a whit less sincere, than the soft glances that have 
6459 just set your heart a-beating from the recesses of yonder opera-box. 
6462 after a pause, in which he had weighed long and well all the pros and 
6463 cons of the invitation. 
6465 “Thanks, but I dine with the Onslows!” lisped out Jekyl, with a languid 
6466 indifference, that however did not prevent his remarking the almost 
6467 incredulous amazement in the colonel's face; “and I perceive,” added he, 
6470 Haggerstone looked after him as he left the room; and then ringing the 
6478 SOMETHING more than a week after the scenes we have just related had 
6479 occurred, the Daltons were seated round the fire, beside which, in the 
6481 Hans Roeckle. A small lamp of three burners such as the peasants use 
6482 stood upon the table, of which only one was lighted, and threw its 
6483 fitful gleam over the board, covered by the materials of a most humble 
6484 meal. Even this was untasted; and it was easy to mark in the downcast 
6485 and depressed countenances of the group that some deep care was weighing 
6486 upon them. 
6488 Dalton himself, with folded arms, sat straight opposite the fire, his 
6489 heavy brows closely knit, and his eyes staring fixedly at the blaze, 
6490 as if expecting some revelation of the future from it; an open letter, 
6492 Nelly, with bent-down head, was occupied in arranging the little 
6493 tools and implements she was accustomed to use in carving; but in the 
6494 tremulous motion of her fingers, and the short, quick heaving of her 
6495 chest, might be read the signs of a struggle that cost heavily to 
6498 Half-concealed beneath the projection of the fireplace sat Kate Dalton 
6500 once did her fingers drop the needle to wipe the gushing tears from her 
6501 eyes, while at intervals a short sob would burst forth, and break the 
6505 at times to smile pleasantly at a little wooden figure the same which 
6508 There was an air of sadness over everything; and even the old spaniel, 
6509 Joan, as she retreated from the heat of the fire, crept with stealthy 
6510 step beneath the table, as if respecting the mournful stillness of the 
6511 scene. How different the picture from what that humble chamber had so 
6512 often presented! What a contrast to those happy evenings, when, as the 
6514 Jean Paul, or the wild and fanciful imaginings of Chamisso, while 
6516 of Ireland, to ask at what they were laughing, and Frank look up 
6517 distractedly from his old chronicles of German war to join in the mirth! 
6518 How, at such moments, Hans would listen to the interpretation, and 
6519 with what greedy ears follow the versions the girls would give of some 
6521 or its beauty marred by transmission! And then those outbreaks of 
6524 which, though clothed in the language of a foreign land, spoke home to 
6525 their hearts with the force that truth alone can speak! 
6527 Yes, they were, indeed, happy evenings! when around their humble hearth 
6528 came thronging the groups of many a poet's fancy, bright pictures of 
6530 unison with their own. They felt no longer the poverty of their humble 
6531 condition, they had no memory for the little straits and trials of the 
6532 bygone day, as they trod with Tieck the alley beneath the lindens 
6533 of some rural village, or sat with Auerbach beneath the porch of the 
6534 Vorsteher's dwelling. The dull realities of life faded before the vivid 
6535 conceptions of fiction, and they imbibed lessons of patient submission 
6536 and trustfulness from those brothers and sisters who are poets' 
6539 And yet what no darkness of adversity could rob them of the first gleam 
6541 already despoiled them. Like the traveller in the fable, who had grasped 
6542 his cloak the faster through the storm, but who threw it away when the 
6543 hot, rays scorched him, they could brave the hurricane, but not face the 
6546 The little wooden clock behind the door struck nine, and Dalton started 
6553 “At what hour was he to come for the answer?” 
6560 we cannot detain them any longer.” 
6566 each other.” 
6569 aside her work, she took her place at the writing-table. 
6577 “Duty! So I'm to be taught my duty as well as the rest!” said he, 
6578 passionately. “Don't you think there are some others might remember that 
6579 they have duties also?” 
6581 “Would that I could fulfil mine as my heart dictates them!” said Ellen; 
6582 and her lip trembled as she spoke the words. 
6584 “Faith! I scarce know what 's my duty, with all the drilling and 
6585 dictating I get,” muttered he, sulkily. “But this I know, there 's no 
6592 to dinner. Another, I 'm told I ought n't to go dine with them. I 'm 
6600 “Well, the more fool me. I know better now. But what's the use of it? 
6601 When the prospect of a little ease and comfort was offered to me, you 
6602 persuaded me to refuse it. Ay, that you did! You began with the old 
6608 “Can you deny it? You made me reject the only piece of kindness ever was 
6609 shown me in a life long. There was the opportunity of spending the rest 
6610 of my days in peace, and you wouldn't let me take it. And the fool I was 
6619 “'T is a droll way of showing affection, then,” said Dal ton, “to keep 
6627 “You surely would not stake all her happiness on the venture, papa?” 
6631 dragging out life in poverty like this, with the proudest friend in our 
6634 “Poor Hanserl!” murmured Nelly, in a low voice; but soft as were the 
6635 accents, the dwarf heard them, and nodded his head twice, as though to 
6639 people,” said Dalton, as he arose and paced the room, the very act of 
6641 just what he always was. But think of me! think of the expectations I 
6642 was reared to, the place I used to hold, and see me now!” 
6649 there left a single one of the comforts I was always accustomed to? 'T 
6651 and the like, and that we never were so happy as now. Faith! I tell you, 
6652 I 'd rather have one day at Mount Dalton, as it used to be long ago, 
6653 than I 'd have twenty years of the life I spend here.” 
6656 rather sit at the window yonder, and listen to a song from Kate, one of 
6658 evening, and talk of Frank, than go back to all the gayety of that wild 
6665 “If I did I was wrong, then,” rejoined he, pushing her rudely away. “It

6689 English relations anything, asking my daughter to join them in their 
6690 visit to Italy. When are we to see the like of that again? Is it every 
6691 day that some rich family will make us the same offer? It's not to cost 
6692 us a sixpence; read the letter, and you 'll see how nicely it 's hinted

6707 Why separate from them? Why rob this humble chamber of its fairest 
6711 “I 'll tell you why, then,” said he, and a sparkling gleam of cunning 
6712 lit up his eye, as the casuistry crossed his mind. “Just because I 
6713 can deny myself anything for my children's sake. 'T is for them I am 
6715 selfish, not the worst enemy he had! Let me feel that my children are 
6716 benefited, and you may leave me to trudge along the weary path before 
6719 “Then there only remains to see if this promise of benefit be real,” 
6725 home! Look at the way they dress the peas with sugar in them. See how 
6726 they shoe a horse with a leg tied up to a post, as if they were going 
6727 to cut it off. Mind the droll fashion they have of fastening a piece of 
6728 timber to the hind wheel of a coach, by way of a drag! There 's no end 
6729 to their contrivances.” 
6732 “What are the dangers that may beset Kate, in a career of such 
6736 would be every charm of that refinement you covet for her, at the price 
6737 of a heart weakened in its attachment to home, bereft of the simple 
6738 faith that there was no disgrace in poverty. Think, above all,” cried 
6739 she and for the first time her lips trembled, and her eyes swam “think, 
6741 back again to these humble fortunes, and the daily toil that she will 
6742 then regard with shame and disgust? I ask not how differently shall we

6751 be; and as for the dangers, devil a one of them I see. Peter Dalton's

6777 was ten miles out of her home? Sit down here now, and write the answer.” 
6779 There was a stern determination in the way these last words were uttered 
6780 that told Nelly how fruitless would be all further opposition. She had 
6781 long since remarked, besides, how her father's temper reacted upon his 
6783 an attack of gout. Increasing age gave to these accesses of malady 
6785 anxiety. Now she saw that immediate compliance with his wishes was the 
6788 She seated herself at the table, and prepared to write. For some seconds 
6789 the disturbance of her thoughts, the mingled crowd of sensations that 
6790 filled her mind, prevented all power of calm consideration; but the 
6793 So silent was the chamber, so hushed was all within it, that the 
6794 scratching noise of the pen alone broke the stillness. Speedily glided 
6795 her hand across the paper, on which two heavy tears had already fallen, 
6798 but she wrote on. She felt that she was to put in motion the series of 
6800 to push over a precipice the rock that in its downward rush would carry 
6803 At last she ceased, and all was still; not a sound was heard in the 
6804 little room, and Nelly leaned her head down upon the table and wept. 
6806 But while she wept she prayed, prayed that if the season of trouble 
6807 her thoughts foreshadowed should be inevitable, and that if the cup of 
6808 sorrow must, indeed, be drained, the strength might be sent them for 
6809 the effort. It might have been that her mind exaggerated the perils of 
6810 separation, and the dangers that would beset one of Kate's temper and 
6811 disposition. Her own bereavement might have impressed her with the 
6818 with the weak and groundless terrors of the frivolous. The closing 
6819 petals of the flower as the storm draws nigh, the wild cry of the 
6820 sea-bird as the squall is gathering, the nestling of the sheep within 
6821 the fold while yet the hurricane has not broke, are signs that, to the 
6827 “You need n't,” said he, roughly. “Of course, it 's full of all the 
6828 elegant phrases women like to cheat each other with. You said she will 
6831 Nelly tried to speak, but the words would not come, and she merely 
6835 relation of the family one that had a kind of right, as I may say, to 
6836 ask her that I 'd never have given my consent. Neither would I!” 
6841 she hesitated a second or so; our gratitude! strange word to express the 
6843 of her to be the mother of her who had none!” 
6851  exclaimed Dalton. “You cried two nights and a day because there was 
6863 “I ask you again, is it into the backwoods of Newfoundland is it into 
6864 the deserts of Arabia she is going?” said Dalton, ironically. 
6866 “The country before her has perils to the full as great, if not greater 
6867 than either,” rejoined Nelly, lowly. 
6869 “There's a ring at the bell,” said Dalton, perhaps not sorry to cut 
6873 resisted. Vanity alone rose above every other motive, and even hardened 
6875 to think that his daughter would be the admired beauty in the salons of 
6876 the great and highly born; that she would be daily moving in a rank the 
6877 most exalted; that his dear Kate would be the attraction of courts, 
6878 the centre of adulation wherever she went. So blinded was he by false 
6881 self-denial! “My worst enemy never called me selfish,” was the balm that 
6883 however, have been rather the part of friend, than of enemy, to have 
6884 whispered that selfishness was the very bane and poison of his nature. 
6885 It was his impulse in all the wasteful extravagance of his early life; 
6886 it was his motive in all the struggles of his adversity. To sustain 
6893 “Lady Hester's courier has come for the answer to her note, papa,” said 
6898 ask him a few questions about these people.” 
6900 “Oh, papa!” whispered Nelly, in a tone at once so reproachful, that the 
6903 “I meant about what time they were to start on the journey,” said he, 
6906 “Lady Hester told us they should leave this to-morrow, sir.” 
6908 “Short notice for us. How is Kate to have all her clothes packed, 
6915 the matter more and more; and there was no end to the note-writing 
6916 besides. I must say that nothing could beat their politeness. It was a 
6917 mighty nice attention, the old man coming himself to call here; and a 
6919 will be. I don't much like Mr. George, as they call him.” 
6921 “Somewhat colder, and more reserved, I think, than the other,” said 
6924 “What a hurry they're in. Is it a return to a writ, that they must

6929 firmly persuaded that in the simple act he was about to perform he was 
6930 achieving a mighty labor, at the cost of much fatigue. 
6932 “No rest for the wicked! as my old father used to say,” muttered he, in 
6933 a happy ignorance whether the philosophy emanated from his parent, or 
6936 such luck! Give me the letter,” said he, querulously. “There is 
6938 half-solemnity, as he pressed the wax with his heavy signet. “'Semper 
6939 eadem;' there 's the ancient motto of our house, and, faith, I believe 
6942 He read the address two or three times over to himself, as if there was 
6943 something pleasurable in the very look of the words, and then he turned 
6945 contemplating the little statue of Marguerite. 
6947 “Is n't it droll to think we 'd be writing to the first in the land, and 
6948 an old toy-maker sitting beside the fire all the time,” said Dalton, 
6949 as he shook his head thoughtfully, in the firm conviction that he had 
6953 “Is it not stranger still that we should have won the friendship of poor 
6954 Hanserl than have attracted the notice of Lady Hester?” said Nelly. “Is 
6956 interest the kindness that has no touch of condescension?” 
6958 “I hope you are not comparing the two,” said Dalton, angrily. “What's 
6959 the creature muttering to himself?” 
6970 behind the massive stove, her face covered with her hands. 
6972 “Zum Fenster hinaus,” repeated he, slowly; “and then, Fraulein? and 
6973 then?” 
6997      From the door.” 
6999 “I hope it isn't in love the creature is,” said Dalton; and he laughed 
7000 heartily at the conceit, turning at the same time his look from the 
7001 dwarf, to bestow a most complacent glance at the remains of his own once

7019 voice was heard for an instant in conversation with the courier, and the 
7020 moment after the door banged heavily, and all was still.

7047 “You'll not forget me, Hanserl?” said the young girl, kindly. 
7049 “Over the great Alps and away!” said Hans, still talking to himself; 
7050 “over the high snow-peaks which cast their shadows on our cold land, but 
7051 have terraces for the vine and olive-garden, yonder! Thou 'It leave us, 
7052 then, Fraulein?” 
7054 “But for a little while, Hans, to come back afterwards and tell thee all 
7057 “They come not back from the sunshine to the shade,” said Hans, 
7058 solemnly. “Thou 'It leave not the palace for the peasant's hut; but 
7059 think of us, Fraulein; think sometimes, when the soft sirocco is playing 
7061 among the orange groves, and near the shadows of old temples, think of 
7062 this simple Fatherland and its green valleys. Think of them with whom 
7071 “Bethink thee well, Fraulein, in thy wanderings, that the great and the 
7072 beautiful are brethren of the good and the simple. The cataract and the 
7073 dewdrop are kindred. Think of all that teaches thee to think of home; 
7074 and remember well, that when thou losest the love of this humble hearth 
7076 dich nicht mehr,' then art thou changed indeed.” Hans sat down upon his 
7079 Nelly watched him silently for a few seconds, and then with a gentle 
7080 hand closed the door and led Kate away. 
7087 THE lamp in Kate Dalton's chamber was still burning when the morning 
7088 dawned, and by its uncertain flicker might be seen the two sisters, who, 
7089 clasped in each other's arms, sat upon the low settle-bed. Nelly, pale 
7092 should awaken her, Nelly had leaned against the wall for support, and, 
7096 It was not alone the grief of an approaching separation that oppressed 
7097 her. Sad as it was to part from one to whom she had been mother and 
7099 fears for the future. Loving Kate dearer than anything in the world, she 
7100 was alive to all the weak traits of her character: her credulity, 
7103 were well known to her; and while, perhaps, these very failings, like 
7104 traits of childish temperament, had actually endeared her the more 
7105 to Nelly, she could not but dread their effect when they came to be 
7106 exercised in the world of strangers. 
7108 Not that Nelly could form the very vaguest conception of what that world 
7110 were all unknown to her. It had never been even the dream-land of 
7112 companionship with the great and titled, she had associated all 
7113 her thoughts with those whose life is labor; with them were all her 
7114 sympathies. There was a simple beauty in the unchanging fortune of the 
7115 peasant's life such as she had seen in the Schwarzwald, for instance 
7116 that captivated her. That peaceful domesticity was the very nearest 
7117 approach to happiness, to her thinking, and she longed for the day when 
7118 her father might consent to the obscurity and solitude of some nameless 
7119 “Dorf” in the dark recesses of that old forest. With Frank and Kate, 
7121 was now to lose the other too. “Strange turn of fortune,” as she said, 
7123 friendless want and necessity we held together; it is only when the 
7127 Nelly,' but Frank, the high-hearted, daring youth, with ambitious hopes 
7128 and soaring aspirations, demands another and a different sphere of 
7131 and self-reproach be if I saw that, in submitting to the same monotony 
7132 of this quietude, they should have become wearied and careless, neither 
7133 taking pleasure in the simple pastimes of the people, nor stooping to 
7134 their companionship! And thus all may be for the best,” said she, half 
7140 apparent hopelessness of all effort to avert calamity, or stem the tide 
7141 of evil fortune, often suggests, as its last consolation, the notion of 
7144 Both of these conditions were Nelly's; she had “supped sorrow” from her 
7145 cradle, while her estimate of herself was the very lowest possible. “I 
7146 suppose it is so,” said she again; “all is for the best.” 
7148 She already pictured to herself the new spring this change of fortune 
7149 would impart to her father's life: with what delight he would read the 
7150 letters from his children; how he would once more, through them, taste 
7152 could have yielded him a gratification like this,” said Nelly, as the 
7153 tears rose in her eyes. “I am but the image of our fallen fortunes, and 
7155 is for the best it must be so!” sighed she, heavily; and just as the 
7156 words escaped, her father, with noiseless step, entered the chamber. 
7160 this is n't the way the Daltons ought to be passing their life, in a 
7163 Kate there just look at her and say, is it a girl like that should be 
7165 sure nobody should know better that there never was the time in the 
7166 world when real beauty had the same chance as now, and I 'd like to see 
7167 the girl that could stand beside her. Do you know, Nelly,” here he drew 
7169 the strangest things might happen to us yet, that Frank might be a great 
7171 money enough to redeem Mount Dalton, and lay my old bones in the 
7178 “And nobody could make the one or the other more neat and comfortable, 
7180 before you were a day under the roof.” 
7182 The young girl blushed deeply; for, humble as the praise might have 
7183 sounded to other ears, to hers it was the most touching she could have 
7186 “I 'm not flattering you a bit. 'T is your own mother you take after; 
7187 you might put her down in the bleakest spot of Ireland, and 't is a

7190 and clean, and the dishes ranged neatly on the dresser; and the pig she 
7191 could n't abide a pig turned out, and the hens driven into the cowshed, 
7192 and the children's faces washed, and their hair combed, and, maybe, the 
7194 or his 'A B C,' while she was teaching his mother how to wind the 
7195 thread off the wheel; for she could spin a hank of yarn as well as any 
7196 cottier's wife in the townland. The kind creature she was! But she never

7209 after all. We spent it when we had it, the Daltons are a good warrant 
7210 for that; and there was he grubbing and grabbing all his days, to leave 
7211 it after him to a rich man, that does n't know whether he has so many

7215 interest, the continuance on the theme which invariably suggested her

7241 suddenly remembered it was Nelly herself who had worked the article in 
7246 colors, too, the Dalton green and white.” 
7248 “Many a time I 've seen the same colors coming in first on the Corralin 
7249 course!” cried Dalton, with enthusiasm; for at the impulse of a new word 
7252 there, in the 'landau,' with your mother, when Baithershin won the Murra 
7253 handicap, the finest day's flat racing I have it from them that seen the 
7254 best in England that ever was run in the kingdom. I won eight hundred 
7255 pounds on it, and, by the same token, lost it all in the evening at 
7256 'blind hookey' with old Major Haggs, of the 5th Foot, not to say a 
7257 trifle more besides. And that 's her trunk!” said he, after another 
7258 pause, his voice dropping at the words, as though to say, “What a change 
7259 of fortune is there! I wonder neither of you hadn't the sense to take 
7260 my old travelling chest; that's twice the size, and as heavy as a lead 
7261 coffin, besides. Sorrow one would ever know if she hadn't clothes for a 
7268 but the show before the world? Did n't I live at Mount Dalton on the 
7269 fat of the laud, and every comfort a gentleman could ask, five years and 
7271 and for whatever I ordered? And why? Because of the house and place! I 
7272 was like the big trunk beyond; nobody knew how little there was in it. 
7277 trouble a little sincerity with the world would save us. 
7283 “I was looking over the map last night, and it ain't so far away, after 
7284 all,” said Dalton. “'T is n't much more than the length of my finger on 
7285 the paper.” 
7293 Poor Nelly was, however, little able to furnish these. Her mind saw 
7294 nothing but sorrow for the present; and, for the future, difficulty, if 
7298 “That's the way it will be always now, when Kate goes. No more gayety in 
7299 the house; not a song nor a merry laugh! I see well what a dreary life 
7300 there is before me.”

7317 IF the arrival of a great family at an hotel be a scene of unusual 
7318 bustle and excitement, with teeming speculations as to the rank and the 
7319 wealth of the new-comers, the departure has also its interests, and 
7320 even of a higher nature. In the former case all is vague, shadowy, and 
7321 uncertain. The eye of the spectator wanders from the muffled figures 
7322 as they descend, to scrutinize the lackeys, and even the luggage, as 
7323 indicative of the strangers' habits and condition; and even to the 
7324 shrewd perceptions of that dread functionary, the head waiter, the 
7325 identity of the traveller assumes no higher form nor any more tangible 
7326 shape than that they are No. 42 or 57. 
7328 When the hour of leave-taking has come, however, their characters have 
7329 become known, their tastes and habits understood, and no mean insight 
7330 obtained into their prejudices, their passions, and their pursuits. The 
7331 imposing old gentleman, whose rubicund nose and white waistcoat are the 
7332 guarantees for a taste in port, has already inspired the landlord with 
7334 and sunshine, have all written themselves legibly in “the bill.” The 
7336 morning, are not unrecorded virtues; while even the pale young ladies, 
7340 Their hours of rising and retiring, their habits of society or 
7341 seclusion, their preferences for the “Post” or the “Times,” have all 
7342 silently been ministering to the estimate formed of them; so that in the 
7343 commonest items of the hotel ledger are the materials for their history. 
7344 And with what true charity are their characters weighed! How readily 
7345 does mine host forgive the transgressions which took their origin in 
7346 his own Burgundy! how blandly smile at the follies begotten of his 
7347 Johannisberg! With what angelic temper does the hostess pardon the 
7349 dear, dear friends would but read us with half the charity, or even 
7350 bestow upon our peccadilloes a tithe of this forgiveness! And why should 
7351 it not be so? What are these same friends and acquaintances but guests 
7352 in the same great inn which we call “the world”? and who, as they never 
7353 take upon them to settle our score, need surely not trouble themselves 
7354 about the “items.” 
7356 While the Daltons were still occupied in the manner our last chapter has 
7357 described, the “Hotel de Russie” was a scene of considerable bustle, the 
7358 preparations for departure engaging every department of the household 
7361 to oil, imperials to buckle on, cap-cases to be secured; and then what a 
7366 of in the most convenient places. Every corridor and landing was blocked 
7367 up with baggage, and the courier wiped his forehead, and “sacre'd” in 
7368 half desperation at the mountain of trunks and portmanteaus that lay 
7372 lacquered leather, with the initials A. J. in brass on the top. 
7378  muttered the other, sulkily. “I know noting of de baggage, since we take 
7382 “What's the matter now, Mister Greg'ry?” said Twig, who very imperfectly 
7383 understood the other's jargon. 
7402 “Mademoiselle,” replied he, politely touching his cap to the 
7405 “Be good enough, Monsieur Gregoire, to have my trunks taken down; there 
7406 are two in the fourgon, and a cap-case on the large carriage.” 
7414 “I'm going away, Monsieur Gregoire. I'm off to Paris,” was the reply, as 
7415 the speaker closed the sash and disappeared. 
7420 “She has given her demission,” said the courier, pompously. “Resign her 
7423 his manners, and all dat but” and here his voice swelled into the full 
7430 “I 've nothing to say to your carriage, Mister Greg'ry. I 'm the 
7436 now waddled into the house to seek for assistance. 
7438 Whatever apathy and indifference he might have met with from the English 
7439 servants, the people of the hotel were like his bond-slaves. Old and 
7440 young, men and women, the waiter, and the ostler, and the chambermaid, 
7442 goes by the name of “Haus-knecht,” a compound of boots, scullion, 
7445 every order he gave, and he stimulated their alacrity by the most 
7446 insulting allusions to their personal defects and deficiencies. 
7450 his edicts right royally, and soon the courtyard was strewn with trunks, 
7452 not devoid of tumult; for, while each of the helpers screamed away at 
7453 the top of his throat, and Gregoire rejoined in shouts that would have 
7454 done credit to a bull, the parrot gave vent to the most terrific cries 
7455 and yells as the ape poked him through the bars of his cage with the 
7458 “There, that's one of them,” cried out Monsieur Gregoire; “that round 
7461 “Monsieur Gregoire! Monsieur Gre'goire!” cried Mademoiselle from the 
7466 “I'm not going, Monsieur Gregoire; the affair is arranged.” 
7472 all the trouble I 've given you.” 
7476 unpacked the whole fourgon.” 
7480 “Belle tigresse!” exclaimed he, returning the leer she bestowed; and the 
7481 window was once more closed upon her exit. “I submitted to the labor, 
7482 in the hope we had done with you forever,” said he, wiping his forehead; 
7483 “and la voila there you are back again. Throw that ape down; away wid 
7484 him, cursed beast!” cried he, venting his spite upon the minion, since 
7485 he dare not attack the mistress. “But what have we here?” 
7487 This latter exclamation was caused by the sudden entrance into the 
7489 fastenings and massive padlock gave it the resemblance of an emigrant's

7505 safer, ay, safer, too, d'ye mind? You see that trunk there; it 's to 
7506 go up with the luggage and be kept dry, for there 's valuable effects 
7512 “It 's a trunk, and belongs to me, and my name is Peter Dalton, as the 
7513 letters there will show you; and so no more about it, but put it up at 
7519 “Be quiet, now, and do as I tell you, my little chap. Put these trifles, 
7525 “It 's not pork; 't is mutton, and a pigeon in the middle,” said Dalton, 
7529 “Is the leetle old man to go too?” asked Gregoire, with an insolent 
7530 grin, and not touching the profanation of either cheese or basket. 
7536 A very deliberate stare, without uttering a word, was all the reply 
7537 Gregoire returned to this speech; and then, addressing himself to the 
7538 helpers, he gave some orders in German about the other trunks. Dalton 
7540 the courier even remembered his presence; and at last he said, 
7547 gray eyes that, had the other known him better, he would scarcely have 
7548 fancied, “that's it, then!” And taking the umbrella from beneath Andy's 
7549 arm, he walked deliberately across the yard to where a large tank stood, 
7551 the post-horses. Some taper rods of ice now stood up in the midst, and a 
7552 tolerably thick coating covered the surface of the basin. 
7554 Gregoire could not help watching the proceedings of the stranger, as 
7555 with the iron-shod umbrella he smashed the ice in one or two places, 
7556 piercing the mass till the water spouted up through the apertures. 
7558 “Have you any friend who live dere?” said the courier, sneeringly, as 
7559 the sound of the blows resembled the noise of a door-knocker. 
7565 “I'll tell you,” said Dalton. “I'm breaking the ice for a new 
7566 acquaintance;” and, as he spoke, he seized the courier by the stout 
7567 leather belt which he wore around his waist, and, notwithstanding his 
7568 struggles and his weight, he jerked him off the ground, and, with a 
7569 swing, would have hurled him head foremost into the tank, when, the 
7570 leather giving way, he fell heavily to the ground, almost senseless from 
7571 shock and fright together. “You may thank that strap for your escape,” 
7572  said Dalton, contemptuously, as he threw towards him the fragments of 
7573 broken leather. 
7580 in it! Sit up there, and mind your business; and, above all, be civil, 
7584 Gregoire, brushing off the dirt from his sleeve, and shaking his cap. 
7589 “Don't, now don't, I tell you,” said Dalton, with another of those 
7590 treacherous smiles whose expression the courier began to comprehend. “No 
7593 “I am no Diener; no serve anybody,” cried the courier, indignantly. 
7597 But somehow there was that in old Dalton's face that gave no 
7598 encouragement to an open resistance, and Monsieur Gregoire knew well the 
7599 case where compliance was the wisest policy. He also knew that in his 
7600 vocation there lay a hundred petty vengeances more than sufficient to 
7602 my times,” was the reflection with which he soothed down his rage, and 
7603 affected to forget the insult he had just suffered under. 
7606 forgive either himself or his neighbor without any great exertion of 
7607 temper, turned now coolly away, and sauntered out into the street. The 
7610 on the little wooden bridge which crossed the stream, and where now two 
7613 They were leaning on the balustrade, and gazing at the mountain that, 
7614 covered with its dense pine-wood, rose abruptly from the river-side. 
7615 It had been the scene of many a happy ramble in the autumn, of many a 
7616 delightful excursion, when, with Frank, they used to seek for fragments 
7617 of wood that suited Nelly's sculptures. How often had they carried their 
7618 little basket up yonder steep path, to eat their humble supper upon the 
7619 rock, from which the setting sun could be seen! There was not a cliff 
7620 nor crag, not a mossy slope, not a grass bank, they did not know; and 
7621 now, as they looked, all the past moments of pleasure were crowding upon 
7622 their memory, tinged with the sad foreboding that they were never again 
7625 “That's the Riesen Fels, Nelly, yonder,” said Kate, as she pointed to a 
7626 tall dark rock, on whose slopes the drifting snow had settled. “How sad 
7628 when the nightingale was singing overhead, and the trickling stream came 
7629 sparkling along the grass when we sat together. I can bear to part with 
7630 it better thus than if all were as beautiful as then.” 
7635 our meeting there again in the next year, Nelly?” 
7639 “And then Frank stood up, with his little gilt goblet, and said, 
7644 “Wiederkehr,” cried Hanserl, supplying the word so aptly. How we all 
7645 laughed, Nelly, at his catching the rhyme!” 
7650 few seconds gazing at the sorrow-struck features of the other. 
7652 “I was thinking, dearest,” said Nelly, “that when we were met together 
7653 there on that night, none of us foresaw what since has happened. Not 
7654 the faintest suspicion of a separation crossed our minds. Our destinies, 
7655 whatever else might betide, seemed at least bound up together. Our very 
7656 poverty was like the guarantee of our unity, and yet see what has come 
7658 speculate on the future, then, when the past has so betrayed us? How 
7659 pilot our course in the storm, when, even in the calm, still sea, we 
7660 have wandered from the track?” 
7662 “Nelly! Nelly! every moment I feel more faint-hearted at the thought of 
7663 separation. It is as though, in the indulgence of a mere caprice, I were 
7668 the brilliant scenes of which you have only read? Is it with the hope 
7670 manners is the constant companion of noble sentiments and right actions; 
7671 or, does there lurk in your heart the longing for a sphere wherein you 
7672 yourself might contest for the prize of admiration? Oh, if this have a 
7674 you are of such homage, the greater is your peril! It is not that I am 
7677 tear from her woman's heart the love of admiration. But for me, I fear, 
7678 for you, Kate, to whom these temptations will be heightened by your own 
7679 deservings. You are beautiful, and you blush as I speak the word; but 
7680 what if the time come when you will hear it unmoved? The modest sense of 
7686 this brilliant future is the hope that I may come back to you more 
7694 around her, and kissed her affectionately. “But, see! there is papa 
7695 yonder; he is beckoning to us to join him;” and the two girls hastened 
7696 forward to where Dalton was standing, at the corner of the street. 
7698 “I'm thinking we ought to go up there, now,” said Dalton, with a motion 
7699 of his hand in the direction of the hotel. “Take my arm, each of you.” 
7701 They obeyed, and walked along in silence, till they reached the inn, 
7707 from the seat he occupied. 
7709 “Can't say, sir,” was the cool response, which he delivered without 
7710 lifting his eyes from the newspaper. 
7713 happened to pass at the moment “do you know, ma'am, if Lady Onslow 's at 
7716 “She never receive in de morning,” was the curt reply. And, with a very 
7717 impudent stare at the two sisters, whose dress imposed no restraint upon 
7723 A folding-door lay open before them into a large chamber, littered with 
7725 these, while he left his daughters outside, Dalton approached a 
7734 “Go to the devil, I say,” cried the doctor; “you've made me cut my 
7735 chin;” and the enraged Grouusell, with his face covered with lather, 
7736 and streaming with blood, flung open the door in a passion. “Oh, Dalton, 
7737 this you, and the ladies here!” said he, springing back ashamed, as 
7739  said he, dragging the father forward and shutting the door upon him. “I 
7741 minutes' talk with you. What answer have you given to the letter they 
7752 was not ignorant of the doctor's sentiments on the subject. 
7759 “On every ground in the world: What has your fine, generous-hearted,

7764 delicacy nothing real and substantial about them but their wickedness? 
7765 If you were a silly woman, like the mother in the 'Vicar of Wakefield,' 
7767 poverty, and knows the rubs of life. I 've no patience with you, d--n me 
7776 Grounsell, as he sliced a piece off his chin, and threw down the 
7781 Dalton sprang to his feet, and clutching the chair, raised it in the 
7782 air; but as suddenly dashed it on the floor again, without speaking. 
7784 “Go on,” cried Grounsell, daring him. “I'd rather you 'd break my skull 
7787 can't wound me, either, by retaliating, and calling me a dependant. I 
7788 know I am such. I know well all the ignominy, all the shame; but I know, 
7789 too, all the misery of the position. But, mark me, the disgrace and the 
7790 sorrow end where they begin, with myself alone. I have none to blush 
7791 for me; I stand alone in the world, a poor, scathed, sapless, leafless 
7795 absolutely nothing of the world as it exists here.” 
7800 better than any man in the county; he, that never was “taken in” by a 
7805 smile at the other's ignorance. “I hope you know more about medicine 
7806 than you seem to do about men and women;” and, with these words, he left 
7807 the room, banging the door after him as he went, and actually ashamed 
7809 the commonest knowledge of the world. 
7813 “I 'm sorry I kept you waiting, girls,” said he, approaching them. “And, 
7815 try and find out her Ladyship now, for the morning is slipping over.” 
7817 As he spoke, George Onslow appeared, and recognizing the party with much 
7818 cordiality, conducted them to the breakfast-room, where Sir Stafford, 
7819 Lady Hester, and Miss Onslow were seated. If Sydney's reception of the 
7821 kind. Nelly was won almost instantaneously by the unaffected ease 
7824 ancestors and their wealth; heard him with assumed interest in all 
7826 opposed to his regrets at the approaching departure of his daughter 
7827 the ingenious consolation that she was not about to sojourn with mere 
7828 strangers, but with those united to her by the ties of kindred. 
7830 conversation; but, whether from the preoccupation of her mind, agitated 
7833 success. A sense of shame, too, at the disparity of her own and her 
7834 sister's appearance, in contrast with the quiet elegance of Lady Hester 
7836 should have agitated her now, she who always hitherto had never wasted a 
7838 from the rustling robe of silk to the folds of her own homely costume, 
7840 changed, that thoughts tike these could impress her so strongly? Had 
7841 Adam's first shame descended to his daughter? “How unlike I am to them!” 
7842  was the bitter thought that rose to her mind, and ate like a cancer into 
7847 importance. There is a sense of indignant anger in the feeling that 
7848 we are surpassed by what seem the mere conventionalities and tricks of 
7849 society, and although Kate knew not the source of her unhappiness, some 
7850 of it lay in this fact. Every little gesture, every motion, the merest 
7853 If it were not for very shame, she would have drawn back now at the 
7854 eleventh hour. More than once was she on the verge of confessing what 
7855 was passing within her mind; but fears of various kinds, of her father's 
7856 anger, of ridicule, of the charge of frivolity, all conspired to keep 
7861 Never did home seem so regrettable as in that moment: the humble 
7862 fireside in winter; the happy evenings with little Hanserl; the summer's 
7863 day rambles in the forest; their little feasts beside the waterfall, 
7864 under the ivy-clad walls of Eberstein, all rose before her. They were 
7865 pleasures which had no alloy in her own humble lot, and why desert them? 
7872 Was this, then, all that was needed to give her the stamp and semblance 
7873 of the others? Oh, if she could believe it! If she could but fancy that, 
7878 “What time de horses, saar?” said the courier, popping his head into the 
7883 “I 'm quite ready this instant if you like indeed, I 'm always the 
7887 further, and that four great imperials and a dozen capacious boxes 
7888 were not packed with her wardrobe. “I do detest the worry and fuss some 
7889 people make about a journey for a week, or even a month beforehand; they 
7890 unsettle themselves and every one around them; putting under lock 
7891 and key half the things of every-day utility, and making a kind of 
7892 'jail-delivery' of all the imprisoned old cloaks and dresses of the 
7893 toilet. As for me, I take the road as I 'd go to the Opera, or drive out 
7894 in the Park I ask for my bonnet, that's all.” 
7898 than if the excursion had been a promenade. 
7907 “By the bye, has any one thought of ordering luncheon here?” cried 
7913 must have them?” 
7916 find that your sketch-book and the water-colors are available at any 
7920 “And de horses, saar?” asked the courier once more, for during this 
7924 that bespoke her dislike to the trouble of even a trifling degree of 
7929 was that the courier should bestow his special attention upon is not on 
7930 record in this history, inasmuch as that when the speaker had reached 
7931 thus far, he passed out of the door, talking as he went, in a low and 
7943 any imposition that took the form of flattery, could at once detect the 
7944 knavery that was practised upon others, and who, at a glance, read the 
7945 character of the new acquaintance. 
7947 “Don't you like the stir and excitement of the road, my dear child?” 
7950 adventurous about a journey always. One may be robbed, you know, or the 
7951 carriage upset, as happened to ourselves t' other day; or mistaken for 
7953 the spirits to think of these things, and a life of monotony is so very 
7956 Kate tried to smile an assent, and Lady Hester ran on in the same 
7957 strain, extolling the delights of anything and everything that promised 
7959 almost been the death of me,” added she. “I never was so bored in all my 
7960 life; and I vow I shall detest a mill and a pine-forest to the last day 
7963 is passed, and when we turn the foot of that hill yonder, we shall have 
7964 seen the last of it.” 
7966 Kate's heart was almost bursting as she heard these words. To speak thus 
7967 of the little valley would have been a profanation at any time, but to 
7969 herself away from all the ties of love and affection, seemed an actual 
7974 producing upon others. “One grows down insensibly to the measure of a 
7985 of thing, is very nice indeed; but there 's luncheon, I see, and now, my 
7990 “but begged you'd not wait; they'll be back presently.” 
7993 drawing Kate's arm within her own, she led her into the adjoining room. 
7995 The party had scarcely seated themselves at table when they were joined 
7999 to say that everything was ready, the postilions in the saddle, the 
8000 carriages drawn up before the door, the relays all been ordered along 
8001 the road, the supper bespoken for the end of the journey. These pleasant 
8003 mimicry, in which the landlord, and Gregoire, and Mademoiselle Celestine 
8004 were the individuals personated. 
8006 Never were Mr. Jekyl's peculiar abilities more in request; for the 
8009 the witty sallies and playful conceits of this clever talker, and felt 
8010 almost grateful to him for the momentary distraction he afforded her 
8012 the graver sentiments of the occasion were swallowed up in the pleasant 
8015 were not sorry to discover the party in this pleasant humor, and readily 
8016 chimed in with the gayety around them. 
8018 The bugle of the postilions at length announced that “time was up,” and 
8019 the half-hour, which German politeness accords to leave-taking, expired. 
8020 A dead silence succeeded the sound, and, as if moved by the same 
8021 instinctive feeling, the two sisters arose and withdrew into a window. 
8022 Close locked in each other's arms, neither could speak. Kate's thick 
8025 the many things she had kept for the last moment, were forgotten, and 
8026 she could but press the wet cheek to her own, and murmur a tremulous 
8038 She had not time for more, when her father joined them. A certain flurry 
8039 of his manner showed that he was excited by talking and wine together. 
8040 There was that in the expression of his features, too, that betokened a 
8043 “'Tis you are the lucky girl, Kate,” said he, drawing his arm around 
8046 gentry, and our own blood into the bargain.” 
8048 A thick heavy sob was all the answer she could make. 
8055 you rather I 'd stay behind with you and Nelly?” cried she, looking up 
8059 then, suddenly checking himself, he said, in an altered voice, “but that 
8061 there, if that's my nature? Not that Nelly will ever give me too good 
8062 a character!” added he, bitterly. But poor Ellen neither heard the 
8063 question nor the taunt; her mind was travelling many a long mile away in 
8067 I believe I must take you away, Miss Dalton; our time is now of the 
8070 One fond and long embrace the sisters took, and Kate was led away 
8071 between Sir Stafford and her father, while Nelly went through a round 
8072 of leave-takings with the others in a state of semi-consciousness that 
8074 powerless on her ear as the rougher good wishes of Grounsell. George 
8075 Onslow's respectful manner was as unnoticed as the flippant smartness 
8077 without heeding; and when one by one they had gone and left her alone 
8079 they stood around her. 
8083 all the turmoil of a departure was there; but she knew nothing of it. 
8084 Even when the loud cracking of the postilions' whips echoed in the 
8085 courtyard, and the quick clatter of horses' feet and heavy wheels 
8086 resounded through the arched doorway, she was still unmoved; nor did she 
8087 recover full liberty of thought till her father stood beside her, and 
8091 her life to have been able to speak even a few words of comfort to the 
8097 Not another word was spoken by either as they trod their way along the 
8098 silent streets, over which the coming gloom of evening threw a mournful 
8100 recognize the objects that they had so often looked upon with her, and, 
8101 slowly traversing the little Platz, they gained their own door. There 
8102 they halted, and, from habit, pulled the bell. Its little tinkle, heard 
8103 in the stillness, seemed suddenly to recall them both to thought; for 
8110 Nelly made no answer. The injustice of the speech was well atoned for in 
8111 her mind by the thought that, in shifting the blame from himself to her, 
8112 her father might find some sort of consolation; well satisfied to become 
8113 the subject of his reproach if the sacrifice could alleviate his sorrow. 
8115 “Take that chair away; throw it out of the window,” cried he, angrily. 
8117 upon the table, and sobbed like a child. 
8124 IN one of the most favored spots of that pleasant quay which goes by 
8125 the name of the Lungo l'Arno, at Florence, there stood a small, 
8128 the force of collision. In all probability it owed its origin to some 
8129 petty usurpation, and had gradually grown up, from the unobtrusive 
8130 humility of a cobbler's bulk, to the more permanent nuisance of stone 
8133 of bridles, halters, and such-like gear, with here and there the 
8134 brass-mounted harnessing of a Calasina, or the gay worsted tassels 
8137 useless; hence, everything that pertained to sale was carried on in the 
8138 street, thus contributing by another ingredient to the annoyance of this 
8141 owner to remove to another part of the town. Gigi every one in Florence 
8143 other resisted oppressions as manfully as he was proof against 
8146 indifference to the jarred nerves and chafed susceptibilities of his 
8147 fine neighbors. It was not that the man was indifferent to money. It was 
8148 not that the place was associated with any family reminiscences. It was 
8149 not from its being very favorable to the nature of his dealings, since 
8150 his chief customers were usually the frequenters of the less fashionable 
8151 localities. It was the simple fact that Gigi was a Florentine, and, like 
8152 a Florentine, he saw no reason why he should n't have the sun and 
8153 the Arno as well as the Guiciardoni, who lived at his right, or the 
8156 Small and contracted as that miserable frontage was, the sun did shine 
8157 upon it just as pleasantly as on its proud neighbors, and the bright 
8158 Arno glided by with its laughing ripples; while, from the little window 
8159 above stairs, the eye ranged over the cypress-clad hill of San Miniato 
8160 and the fair gardens of the Boboli. On one side lay the quaint old 
8161 structure of the Ponte Vecchio, with its glittering stores of jewelry, 
8162 and on the other the graceful elliptic arches of St. Trinita spanned the 
8163 stream. The quay before the door was the chosen rallying-point of 
8164 all Florence; the promenade where lounged all its fashionables of an 
8165 evening, as they descended from their carriages after the accustomed 
8166 drive in the Cascini. The Guardie Nobili passed daily, in all their 
8167 scarlet bravery, to and from the Pitti Palace; the Grand Ducal equipage 
8168 never took any other road. A continual flow of travellers to the great 
8169 hotels on the quay contributed its share of bustle and animation to the 
8171 up the life, the stir, and the movement of the capital. 
8175 between the chaotic wares of Gigi's shop, to ascend the little, dark, 
8176 and creaking stairs which lead to the first story, and into which we now 
8177 beg to introduce our reader. There are but two rooms, each of them of 
8178 the dimensions of closets, but furnished with a degree of pretension 
8181 on the floor, an alabaster lamp suspended from the ceiling, miniatures 
8182 in handsome frames, and armor, cover the walls; while, scattered about, 
8184 the half-drawn curtain that covers the doorway for there is no door 
8185 you can peep into the back room, where a lighter and more modern taste 
8186 prevails; the gold-sprigged curtains of a French bed, and the Bohemian 
8187 glass that glitters everywhere, bespeaking another era of decorative 
8191 the interests of truth, that we must now tell our reader that, of all 
8193 The brocaded silks have been old petticoats; the ebony is lacquer; the 
8194 ivory is bone; the statuettes are plaster, glazed so as to look like 
8195 marble; the armor is papier mache, even to the owner himself, all is 
8196 imposition, for he is no other than Albert Jekyl. 
8198 Now, my dear reader, you and I see these things precisely in the same 
8200 examine, one by one, the ingenious devices meant to counterfeit ancient 
8202 amusement from the ingenuity exercised, as we should have had pleasure 
8203 in contemplating the realities so typified. Still, there is one 
8205 Jekyl has persuaded himself to accept all as fact. Like the Indian, 
8206 who first carves and then worships his god, he has gone through the old 
8207 process of fabrication, and now gazes on his handiwork with the eyes 
8208 of a true believer. Gracefully reclined upon an ottoman, the mock amber 
8212 thousands might live in enjoyment out of the superfluities of rich men, 
8213 and yet make them nothing the poorer. What banquet would not admit of 
8214 a guest the more? What fete to which another might not be added? What 
8215 four-in-hand prances by without some vacant seat, be it even in the 
8217 “complement” to the world's want is then his mission. 
8220 creative power is an earnest of victory. It is true that there had been 
8221 great men before Agamemnon. So had there been a race of “diners-out” 
8222  before Jekyl; but he first reduced the practice to system, showing 
8223 that all the triumphs of cookery, all the splendor of equipage, all the 
8224 blandishments of beauty, all the fascinations of high society, may be 
8225 enjoyed by one who actually does not hold a “share in the company,” and, 
8226 without the qualification of scrip, takes his place among the directors. 
8233 successful doctor for nervous invalids; a clever practitioner at the 
8234 bar; an admirable member of the newspaper press. He might have been very 
8237 conscience, what bound need there be to his success! Nor was there. 
8238 He was, in all the society of the capital, not alone an admitted and 
8243 seemed to lie in the fact that, if generally easy to be found when 
8244 required, he was never in the way when not wanted. Had he possessed the 
8250 hand, with a sudden burst of intelligence suggesting “to come another 
8256 perception of his own fitness, resolved to exercise upon the world 
8258 analysis of men's motives. It is true, perhaps, that the poet's line may 
8260 “the proper study of mankind is man,” his investigations took a shape 
8261 scarcely contemplated by the writer. It was not man in his freedom of 
8262 thought and action, not man in all the consciousness of power, and in 
8263 the high hope of a great destiny that attracted him; no! it was for 
8264 small humanity that he cared, for all the struggles and wiles and plots 
8268 He felt, with the great dramatist, that “all the world's a stage,” 
8269  and, the better to enjoy the performance, he merely took a “walking 
8270 character,” that gave him full leisure to watch the others. Such was our 
8272 Le Due de Dine-out, to distinguish him from the Talleyrands, who are 
8275 Let us now, without further speculation, come back to him, as with his 
8276 window open to admit the “Arno sun,” he lay at full length upon his 
8278 from Florence, and in the interval a number of new people had arrived, 
8279 and some of the old had gone away. He was, therefore, running over the 
8280 names of the present and the missing, with a speculative thought for the 
8284 the list of English names, in which none of any distinction figured. 
8287 numbers have gone away, too, the Scotts, the Carringdons, the Hopleys! 
8289 'reconciled to Rome,' as the phrase is, 'took out their piety' in Friday 
8292 “The Russians, too, have left us; the Geroboffskys gone back to their 
8293 snows again, and expiating their 'liberal tendencies' by a tour in 
8298 pleasant haunt for all seasons and at all hours, what is there? Nothing, 
8301 left ruin to their creditors at home, to come out and live gloriously 
8303 at 'Marescotte's,' and that half luncheon thing I take at the Villa 
8304 Pessarole, I really see nothing for the whole week. The Onslows, alone, 
8305 figure in strong capitals. Let me see, then, how they must be treated. I 
8306 have already housed them at the Palazzo Mazzarini, and, for some days at 
8307 least, their time will be filled up with upholsterers, decorators, 
8308 and such-like. Then the campaign will open, and I can but watch 
8309 eventualities, and there will be no lack of these. The young Guardsman 
8312 ends in a love of saints' shin-bones and other relics. My lady is 
8313 disposed to be a 'fast one;' and, in fact, except the gruff old doctor, 
8314 who is a confounded bore, the whole craft is deficient in ballast. But 
8315 I was forgetting 'the Dalton,' shame on me, for she is very pretty, 
8316 indeed!” He seemed to ruminate and reflect for some minutes, and then 
8317 said aloud, “Yes, ma belle Catharine, with the aid of Albert Jekyl, with 
8318 his counsel to guide, and his head to direct you, there 's no saying 
8320 convince you of the fact, and, possibly, were I to try it, you 'd be 
8324 these days. You 'll learn the immense benefit my knowledge would be when 
8326 too late; then, like every one else, you 'll have played all your trumps 
8327 before you begin to learn the game. A girl who has caught up every trick 
8329 this hour, would stand the scrutiny of the most fastidious eye, is a 
8330 great prize in the wheel. This aptitude might lead to great things, 
8336 during the whole morning. It was to him a period of self-examination. 
8341 his costume, while partaking of all the characteristics of the morning, 
8346 so to dine, not only from the want of dignity incurred, but that on 
8347 principle he would have preferred the humblest fare at home to the 
8351 His dress being completed, he looked out along the crowd to see in whose 
8352 carriage he was to have a seat to the Cascini. More than one inviting 
8354 but although some of those who sought him were high in rank, and others 
8355 distinguished for beauty and attraction, Jekyl declined the courtesies 
8356 with that little wave of the hand so significative in all Italian 
8358 convey the sorrow the refusal cost him; and once he actually placed his 
8363 peeped from beneath the head of a very shabby caleche, whose horse and 
8364 coachman were all of the “seediest;” and Jekyl cried out, “Morlache!” 
8365  while he made a sign towards the Cascini. The other replied by spreading 
8366 out his hand horizontally from his mouth, and blowing along the surface, 
8376 which defies all attempts at portraiture. Well-bred people, and their 
8378 traits pervading them throughout, that every effort at individualization 
8379 is certain to be a failure. You may change the venue, if you will, from 
8380 London to Paris, to Vienna, or St. Petersburg, but the issue is always 
8381 the same; the very same interests are at work, and the same passions 
8382 exercised, by the self-same kind of people. If such be the rule among 
8383 the first-rate capitals of Europe, it is very far from being the case 
8385 reasons of health, pleasure, or economy, are the resort of strangers 
8386 from different parts of the world. In these society is less disciplined, 
8388 disturb the scene, and there is, so to say, a kind of struggle for 
8390 If, as is unquestionably true, such places rarely present the 
8391 attractions of good society, they offer to the mere observer infinitely 
8393 elsewhere. As in the few days of a revolution, when the “barricades are 
8394 up,” and all hurrying to the conflict, more of national character will 
8395 be exhibited than in half a century of tame obedience to the law; so 
8396 here are displayed, to the sun and the noonday, all those passions and 
8397 pretensions which rarely see the light in other places. 
8399 The great besetting sin of this social state is the taste for NOTORIETY. 
8402 “Better be calumniated in all the moods and tenses than untalked of,” is 
8403 the grand axiom. Do something that can be reported of you, good, if you 
8405 by the caprices of your wealth, do something by your wits, or even your 
8409 perfectly tranquil, the Onslows were now launched, as well pleased as 
8411 in their own country, suddenly awake to the fact that they are 
8415 been one of the Borghese family, whose princely fortune was still unable 
8416 to maintain the splendor of a residence fitted only for royalty. To 
8417 learn, therefore, that a rich “milordo” had arrived there with the 
8419 tongue in the city. Gossips were questioned about the private history, 
8420 the peerage consulted for such facts as were public. Sir Stafford's 
8423 investigation into their probable reasons for leaving England was also 
8425 prominently. What they were like what they said, did, and meant to do 
8426 was the sole table-talk of the capital. 
8428 “They've had their horses out from England,” said one; “They 've 
8429 taken the best box at the Pergola,” said another; “They've engaged 
8431 about his band,” chimed in a fourth; and so on. All their proceedings 
8435 Nor were the Onslows without offering food for this curious solicitude. 
8436 From the hour of her arrival, Lady Hester had been deeply engaged, in 
8437 concert with her grand vizier, Albert Jekyl, in preparations for the 
8439 beset the Palazzo with enormous vans crammed full of wares. Furniture, 
8442 and hangings that had been the admiration of many a visitor, were 
8445 the pictures, and a few tables of malachite or marble, little or nothing 
8446 remained of what once constituted the splendor of the place. 
8449 himself, had seen the interior; and from him, unless disposed to accord 
8453 the suspicion of all who had not studied him deeply. What the Onslows 
8454 were going to do, and when they would do it, were, then, the vexed 
8455 questions of every coterie. In a few days more the Carnival would begin, 
8456 and yet no announcement of their intentions had yet gone forth, no 
8457 programme of future festivities been issued to the world. A vague and 
8458 terrible fear began to prevail that it was possible they meant all 
8459 these splendid preparations for themselves alone. Such a treason was 
8461 suspicion ripened into actual dread; and now the eager expectants began 
8462 to whisper among themselves dark reasons for a conduct so strange and 
8465 Haggerstone contributed his share to these mysterious doublings, for, 
8466 while not confessing that his acquaintance with the Onslows was of the 
8467 very slightest, and dated but from a week before, he spoke of them with 
8468 all the affected ease and information of one who had known them for 
8471 Nor were his comments of the most flattering kind, for seeing how 
8474 interval of doubt which had occurred as to their probable mode of life 
8475 was favorable for this line of action. None knew if they were ever to 
8476 partake of the splendor and magnificence of the Mazzarini; none could 
8477 guess what chance they had of the sumptuous banquets of the rich man's 
8478 table. It was a lottery, in which, as yet, they had not even a ticket; 
8479 and what so natural as to depreciate the scheme! 
8481 If the courts of law and equity be the recognized tribunals by which the 
8482 rights of property are decided, so there exists in every city certain 
8484 claims, and deliver judgments upon the pretensions of every new arrival 
8485 amongst them. High amid the number of these was a certain family called 
8488 maiden sister of the General. They inhabited a small house in a garden 
8489 within the boulevard, dignified by the name of the “41 Villino Zoe.” It 
8490 had originally been the humble residence of a market-gardener, but, by 
8491 the aid of paint and plaster, contrived to impose upon the world almost 
8492 as successfully as did the fair owner herself by the help of similar 
8493 adjuncts. A word, however, for the humanities before we speak of their 
8502 that one day the world would awake to the recognition of his great 
8509 inoffensive than such an existence. Even the French our natural enemies 
8510 or the Russians our Palmerstonian Betes noires would have forgiven, had 
8511 they but seen, the devices of his patriotism. Never did heroic ardor 
8512 burn in a milder bosom, for, though his brain revelled in all the 
8513 horrors of siege and slaughter, he would not have had the heart to crush 
8516 Unlike him in every respect was the partner of his joys: a more 
8519 “legion.” When Columbus received the taunts of the courtiers on the ease 
8520 of his discovery, and merely replied, that the merit lay simply in the 
8522 very wide application. Nine tenths of the inventions which promote 
8523 the happiness or secure the ease of mankind have been not a whit more 
8524 difficult than that of balancing the egg. They only needed that some one 
8525 should think of them “practically.” Thousands may have done so in 
8526 moods of speculation or fancy; the grand requisite was a practical 
8528 the lava used for mere road-making, which in other hands, and by other 
8529 treatment, might have been fashioned into all the shapes and colors 
8531 equally misapplied and devoted to base uses, but which, by the touch 
8532 of genius, might be made powerful as the wand of an enchanter. This was 
8533 “Flattery.” Do not, like the Spanish courtiers, my dear reader, do not 
8535 an old and exhausted mine. Her flattery was not, as the world employs 
8537 and creative power, that actually begot the great sublime it praised. 
8541 fitted all her slaves; and slaves were they of the most abject slavery, 
8542 who were led by the dictation of her crafty intelligence! 
8544 A word about poor Martha, and we have done; nor, indeed, is there any 
8546 Martha” by all their acquaintance. Oh! what patience, submission, and 
8547 long suffering it takes before the world will confer its degree of 
8548 Martyr, before they will condescend to visit, even with so cheap a thing 
8549 as compassion, the life of an enduring self-devotion. Martha had had but 
8550 one idol all her life, her brother; and although, when he married late 
8551 in years, she had almost died broken-hearted at the shock, she clung to 
8555 knowledge of the world; but to see her at the time of which we now 
8556 speak, not a vestige remained of either, not a stone marked where the 
8558 passed years amid all the phantasmagoria of that unreal existence, and 
8559 either not gone clean mad, or made a weak compromise with sanity, 
8560 by accepting everything as real? Poor Martha had exactly these two 
8561 alternatives, either to “believe the crusts mutton,” or be eternally 
8562 shut out from all hope. Who can tell the long and terrible struggle such 
8565 and the affection she bore her brother? 
8569 that, like a true devotee, she would not trust the evidence of her own 
8570 senses, if opposed by the articles of her belief. The very pictures 
8572 relacquering had been the work of her own hands, she was willing to aver 
8573 had been the gifts of royal and princely personages. The books for which 
8574 she had herself written to the publishers, she would swear all tributes 
8575 offered by the respective writers to the throne of taste and erudition. 
8578 rote, she repeated with full credulity. Like the well-known athlete, who 
8579 lifted a bull because he had accustomed himself to the feat since 
8580 the animal had been a calf, rising from small beginnings, she had so 
8582 the straits and contrivances by which this motley display was got up, 
8583 not all the previous schemings and plottings, not all the discussions 
8586 the firmness of her faith when the matter was once decided. She might 
8587 oppose the Bill in every stage; she might cavil at it in Committee, and 
8589 a statute of the land. All her own doubts faded away on the instant; all 
8591 on her mind, and she appeared to see with the eyes of truth and 
8593 and have no space to devote to that temple wherein the mysteries were 
8595 discomfort increased by the incongruous collection of rare and curious 
8596 objects by which it was filled. Stuffed lions stood in the hall; mock 
8597 men in armor guarded the entrance to the library; vast glass cases 
8600 curiosities, covered the walls on every side. Not a specimen amongst 
8601 them that could not trace its presentation to some illustrious donor. 
8604 Chalmers, and took in the whole range of morals, from Mrs. Opie to Fanny 
8605 Elssler. Indeed, although the fair Zoe was a “rigid virtue,” her love of 
8613 acquaintances as another in that long catalogue of those who came to lay 
8614 the tribute of their genius at her feet. 
8619 the fact. The real serious business of life is often carried on in 
8621 their millions, subsidize states, and raise loans in dens dark and 
8622 dismal enough to be prison-cells. In the same way, the Villino was a 
8623 recognized rendezvous of all who wanted to hear what was going on in the 
8625 the day. Not that such was ever the tone of the conversation; on the 
8626 contrary, it was “all taste and the musical glasses,” the “naughty talk” 
8627  being the mere asides of the scene. 
8629 Now, in that season of foreign life which precedes the Carnival, and on 
8630 those nights when there is no opera, any one benevolent enough to open 
8631 his doors to receive is sure of full houses; so the Villino “improved 
8632 the occasion,” by announcing a series of Tuesdays and Fridays, which 
8633 were, as the papers say, frequented by all the rank and fashion of the 
8634 metropolis. It is at one of these “at homes” that we would now present 
8635 our reader, not, indeed, during the full moon of the reception, when 
8636 the crowded rooms, suffocating with heat, were crammed with visitors, 
8638 The great melee tournament was over, and a few lingered over the now 
8639 empty lists, discussing in familiar converse the departed guests and the 
8640 events of the evening. 
8642 This privy council consisted of the reader's old acquaintance, 
8645 the rank of an enemy to the Emperor, but whose private resources, it 
8646 was rumored, came from the Imperial treasury to reward his services as 
8647 a spy; a certain Mr. Scroope Purvis, the brother of Mrs. Ricketts, 
8648 completing the party. He was a little, rosy-cheeked old man, with a limp 
8650 some accident or other, he invariably got all wrong, never, on even the 
8653 Such were the individuals of a group which sat around the fire in close 
8654 and secret confab., Mrs. Ricketts herself placed in the midst, her fair 
8656 all the quarterings and emblazonment of her family for centuries back. 
8657 The “Bill” before the house was the Onslows, whose res gestee were 
8660 “Have dey return your call, madam?” asked the Pole, with an almost 
8664 parenthesis, was “inexact,” the visit had been made eight days before. 
8667 said, 'you must really take them in hand.'” 
8672 must see what line they adopt here; rank and wealth have no influence 
8675 “I take it, then, your circle will be more select than amusing this 
8679 rock, with I forget the quotation.” 
8681 “With the phos-phos-phos-phate of lime upon it?” said Purvis, “that new 
8688 always carried himself into the seventh heaven of enjoyment, “you would

8695 reason of their coming abroad?” 
8698 connection between our families, although I should be very sorry they 'd 
8699 hear of it, the Badelys and the Harringtons are first cousins.” 
8701 “Oh, to be sure!” broke in Purvis. “Jane Harrington was father; no, no, 
8702 not father she was mo-mo-mother of Tom Badely; no! that is n't it, she 
8703 was his aunt, or his brother-in-law, I forget which.” 
8706 a breach of common law,” said Haggerstone, tartly, “and leave the 
8709 “How I do dislike dat English habit of countin' cousins,” said the 
8714 “Financial reasons, then, might dictate retirement,” said Mrs. Ricketts, 
8715 coming back to the original theme. 
8718 the remark. 
8723 “Do he play? What for play is he fond of?” asked the Pole, eagerly. 
8725 “Play, sir? There is nothing an Englishman will not play at, from the 
8728 “So Hamlet say, in Shakspeare, 'de play is de ting,'” cried the Count, 
8729 with the air of a man who made a happy quotation. 
8737 “No, it is n't that,” broke in Purvis; “they are to have what they call 
8740 “I trust they have engaged your services as Solomon, sir,” said 
8744 “I heard the subject of one of them,” resumed the other, who was far too 
8745 occupied with his theme to bestow a thought upon a sarcasm. “There's a 
8748 “Her mamma,” suggested the Pole. 
8754 who was always ready to suppress the bore by a call to order on the 
8767 “She is the niece no, she's the aunt or rather her father is aunt to 
8772 “Oh, I have it now!” broke in Purvis. “It was her mother; Miss 
8773 Da-a-alton's mother was uncle to a Stafford.” 
8775 “Perhaps I can shorten the pedigree,” said Haggerstone, tartly. “The 
8776 young lady is the daughter of a man whom this same Sir Stafford tricked 
8777 out of his fortune; they were distant relatives, so he had n't even the 
8781 unimpeachable, and that the Onslows have not even the shadow of a case 
8784 “An' have de lady no broder nor sister?” asked the Count, who had heard 
8787 “She has, sir, both brother and sister, but both illegitimate, so that 
8788 this girl is the heiress to the estate.” 
8790 “And probably destined to be the wife of the young Guardsman,” said Mrs. 
8800 really believe that we are not a jot worse than were the patriarchs of 
8803 “Ah, oui, les patriarches!” echoed the Pole, laughing, and always ready 
8811 and a good milliner, would be downright beautiful. Of course these 
8812 are adjuncts she is little likely to find during her sojourn with the 
8816 Mrs. Ricketts, while she threw her eyes over the cracked china 
8818 intellectuality and refinement might compensate for the vulgar pleasures 
8821 “She may want such, one of these days, yet, or I'm much mistaken,” said 
8826 certain to follow! What an excellent stable will come to the hammer 
8827 then! There 's a 'Bone setter' colt worth a thousand guineas, with his 
8830 And now there was a little pause in the dialogue, while each followed 
8831 out the thoughts of his own mind. Haggerstoue's were upon the admirable 
8833 of their value; Mrs. Ricketts was pondering over the good policy of 
8836 in marriage to some unprovided-for cousin; the Pole's dreams were of a 
8837 rich wife; and Purvis, less ambitious than the rest, merely revelled in 
8838 the thought of all the gossip this great event, when it should come off, 
8839 would afford him; the innumerable anecdotes he would have to retail of 
8840 the family and their wastefulness; the tea-parties he should enliven 
8841 by his narratives; the soirees he would amuse with his sallies. Blessed 
8843 than all the qualities and attributes of genius! 
8845 “Dat is ver pretty indeed, tres jolie!” said the Count, bestowing a look 
8846 of approval at the embroidery-frame, whereupon, for eight mortal months, 
8847 poor Martha labored at the emblazonment of the Ricketts' arms; “de 
8857 “You are leaving us early, Colonel,” said the old General, as he 
8858 awoke from a long nap on the little corner sofa, which formed his 
8863 them good-night. The others, also, took their leave and departed. 
8871 been one round of brilliant enjoyment. To the pleasure of the journey, 
8872 with all its varied objects of interest, the picturesque scenery of the 
8873 Via Mala, the desolate grandeur of the Splugen, the calm and tranquil 
8874 beauty of Como, succeeded the thousand treasures of art in the great 
8875 cities where they halted. At first every image and object seemed 
8877 Nelly think or say of this? was the ever-recurring question of her mind. 
8879 of the wonderful things that every moment met her eyes? The quick 
8881 bring back to that “dear fireside” of home. The Onslows themselves, who 
8883 in the freshness of the young girl's admiration. It gave them, as 
8885 collections of all that was rare and curious, nothing struck them as 
8886 half so surprising as the boundless delight of her unhackneyed nature. 
8888 Educated to a certain extent by watching the pursuits of her sister, 
8891 appreciating the beauty of art, a species of relation appearing almost 
8892 to subsist between the two. 
8894 Gifted with this instinct, there was an intensity in all her enjoyments, 
8895 which displayed itself in the animation of her manner and the elevated 
8897 seldom able to resist the influence of this enthusiasm; however hard the 
8898 metal of their hearts, they must melt beneath this flame. Lady Hester 
8899 Onslow herself could not remain insensible to the pure sincerity and 
8900 generous warmth of this artless girl. For a time the combat, silent, 
8901 unseen, but eventful, was maintained between these two opposite natures, 
8902 the principle of good warring with the instincts of evil. The victory 
8903 might have rested with the true cause there was every prospect of its 
8907 she had always looked up to her as a mother, nor did the unhappy 
8908 circumstances of her father's second marriage tend to weaken this 
8909 feeling of attachment. The sad news reached them at Genoa; and Sydney, 
8910 accompanied by Dr. Grounsell, at once set out for London. If the sudden 
8911 separation of the two girls, just at the very moment of a budding 
8912 friendship, was sorrowfully felt by both, to Lady Hester the event was 
8915 She never had liked Sydney; she now detested the notion of a 
8916 step-daughter, almost of her own age, in the same society with herself; 
8917 she dreaded, besides, the influence that she had already acquired over 
8919 It was not from any feeling of attachment or affection, it was the pure 
8921 away Kate from her friends and home had been her own; she, therefore, 
8922 owned her; the original title was vested in her: the young girl's whole 
8924 dictation. To be free of Sydney and the odious doctor by the same event 
8925 was a double happiness, which, in spite of all the decorous restraints 
8926 bad news impose, actually displayed itself in the most palpable form. 
8928 The Palazzo Mazzarini was now to be opened to the world, with all the 
8929 splendor wealth could bestow, untrammelled by any restriction the taste 
8930 of Sydney or the prudence of the doctor might impose. Sir Stafford, ever 
8932 to nothing. The cheapness of Italy, the expectations formed of an 
8933 Englishman, were the arguments which always silenced him if he ventured 
8934 on the very mildest remonstrance about expenditure; and Jekyl was 
8935 immediately called into the witness-box, to show that among the 
8936 economies of the Continent nothing was so striking as the facilities of 
8937 entertaining. George, as might be supposed, had no dislike to see their 
8938 own house the great centre of society, and himself the much sought-after 
8939 and caressed youth of the capital. 
8942 could elevate and exalt it, refinement of manners, taste, luxury, the 
8943 fascinations of wit, the glitter of conversational brilliancy. She had 
8946 others, and which elevates the possessor of a great quality into a 
8947 species of petty sovereignty above their fellows. Her progress in 
8952 It was not easy at first for Kate to believe in the fact at all that she 
8955 bearing bore the stamp of breeding and tact. Mademoiselle Nina had been 
8956 the maid of the Princess Menzikoff, the most distinguished belle 
8957 of Florence, the model of taste and elegance in dress; but when the 
8959 had involved the name of the femme de chambre, so that, instead of 
8961 might readily have done, she had disappeared for a while from the scene 
8963 seclusion to accept the humble position of Kate Dalton's maid. She was a 
8965 and neatly formed, her head was too large for her size, and the forehead 
8966 over-large for the face, the brows and temples being developed 
8968 stern-looking, and sleepy, sadness, or rather weariness, being the 
8969 characteristic expression of the face. Her mouth, however, when she 
8971 manner was that of great distance and respect, the trained observance of 
8972 one who had been always held in the firm hand of discipline, and never 
8973 suffered to assume the slightest approach to a liberty. She contrived, 
8974 however, even in her silence, or in the very few words she ever uttered, 
8975 to throw an air of devotion into her service that took away from the 
8977 Kate, indeed, in the beginning, was thrown back by the studied reserve 
8979 grew more accustomed to the girl's manner, she began to feel pleased 
8980 with the placid and unchanging demeanor that seemed to bespeak a mind 
8985 Nina, whose place was beside the window, worked away with bent-down 
8986 head, not seeming to have a thought save for the occupation before her. 
8988 upon the tenor of her thoughts, or wending far away on errands of 
8989 speculation. Now she would turn her eye from the page to gaze in 
8990 wondering delight at the tasteful decorations of her little chamber, a 
8991 perfect gem of elegance in all its details; then she would start up to 
8992 step out upon the terrace, where even in winter the orange-trees were 
8993 standing, shedding their sweet odor at every breeze from the Arno. With 
8994 what rapturous delight she would follow the windings of that bright 
8995 river, till it was lost in the dark woods of the Cascini! How the sounds 
8996 of passing equipages, the glitter and display of the moving throng, 
8997 stirred her heart; and then, as she turned back within the room, with 
8998 what a thrill of ecstasy her eyes rested on the splendid ball-dress 
8999 which Nina had just laid upon the sofa! With a trembling hand she 
9000 touched the delicate tissue of Brussels lace, and placed it over her 
9008 and subtle meaning, as she watched the young girl's gesture.

9039 “Nelly would be so happy here, wandering through these galleries, and 
9042 how to profit by these treasures of art. The frivolous enjoyments 
9051 A half cry of delight burst from Kate as she saw the effect in the 
9061 “You, Mademoiselle,” cried Nina, and for the first time a slight warmth 
9062 coloring the tone of her manner, “you, Mademoiselle, the belle, the 
9063 beauty, the acknowledged beauty of Florence!” 
9067 “I hope Mademoiselle will forgive me. I would not for the world fail in 
9069 what others spoke.” 
9075 “Every one, Mademoiselle, every one, as they were standing beneath the 
9076 terrace t' other evening. I overheard Count Labinski say it to Captain 
9077 Onslow; and then my Lady took it up, and said, 'You are quite right, 
9078 gentlemen; there is nothing that approaches her in beauty.'” 
9082 “The Count de Melzi was more enthusiastic than even the rest. He vowed 
9086 had gone too far. And now she resumed her seat at the writing-table. 
9087 It was of the Splugen Pass and Como she had been writing; of the first 
9088 burst of Italy upon the senses, as, crossing the High Alps, the land of 
9089 the terraced vine lay stretched beneath. She tried to fall back upon the 
9091 Other and far different thoughts had gained the mastery. It was no 
9092 longer the calm lake, on whose mirrored surface snow-peaks and glaciers 
9093 were reflected; it was not of those crags, over which the wild-fig and 
9094 the olive, the oleander and the mimosa, are spreading, she could think. 
9095 Other images crowded to her brain; troops of admirers were before her 
9096 fancy; the hum of adulation filled her ears; splendid salons, resounding 
9099 transition was most abrupt, then, from a description of scenery and 
9100 natural objects to a narrative of the actual life of Florence: 
9106      wonderful mimic. You 'd swear Dr. Grounsell was in the next 
9110      Midchekoff's, which is better than the royal box, and has 
9111      not succeeded. For this reason we have not yet been to the 
9112      Opera; and, as the Palace has been undergoing a total change 
9113      of decoration and furniture, there has been no reception 
9116      would be nothing to the reality of what I see here. Such 
9120      such delicious flowers everywhere on the staircase, in the 
9128      me at first to hear it, I now see that they were perfectly 
9130      shoulders; and Nina tells me there never was such an 
9131      improvement, as the character of my features requires 
9133      there is endless toilette here; and although I am now 
9137      called; very clever, deeply interesting, but not the kind of 
9138      reading you would like; at least, neither the scenes nor the 
9140      to be a good picture of life in another sphere from what I 
9141      have seen myself; and if it be, I must say there is more 
9143      however, I cannot help admiring, the extreme care that every 
9144      one takes never to give even the slightest offence; not only 
9145      that the wrong thing is never said, but ever even suggested. 
9146      Such an excessive deference to others' feelings bespeaks 
9149      the charm of her manner grows into a fascination. Captain 
9151      gay; and as for Sir Stafford, he is like a father in the 
9155      sisterlike. We are to write to each other if she does not 
9156      return soon. I intended to have said so much about the 
9160      less from intrinsic merit than from the choice of subject 
9161      and the train of thoughts they originate; and for this 
9162      reason I prefer Salvator Rosa to all other painters. The 
9163      romantic character of his scenery, the kind of story that 
9164      seems to surround his characters, the solemn tranquillity of 
9165      his moonlights, the mellow splendor of his sunsets, actually 
9166      heighten one's enjoyment of the realities in nature. I am 
9168      Titian, whose portraits appear to reveal the whole character 
9169      and life of the individual represented. In Velasq'uez there 
9170      is another feature--” 
9173 choose, and now arose the difficult decision between a fringe of silver 
9175 sides of which Mademoiselle Nina had much to say. In all these little 
9176 discussions, the mock importance lent to mere trifles at first amused 
9178 only to listen to them with attention, but even to take her share in 
9179 the consultation. Nina's great art lay in her capacity for adapting a 
9180 costume to the peculiar style and character of the wearer; and, however 
9181 exaggerated were some of her notions on this subject, there was always 
9183 any absurdity in her theory. Kate Dalton, whose whole nature had been 
9187 de paysanna to walk in the garden, and this again for a species of 
9188 hunting-dress to ride in the Cascini, to appear afterwards at dinner in 
9189 some new type of a past age; an endless variety of these devices at last 
9190 engaging attention, and occupying time, to the utter exclusion of topics 
9193 The letter was now to be resumed; but the clew was lost, and her mind 
9195 the terrace to recover her composure; but beneath the window was rolling 
9196 on that endless tide of people and carriages that swells up the great 
9197 flood of a capital city. She turned her steps to another side, 
9198 and there, in the pleasure-ground, was George Onslow, with a great 
9199 horse-sheet round him, accustoming a newly purchased Arabian to the 
9201 the day before. Everything she saw, everything she heard, recalled but 
9206 of egotism, which lulls the conscience by the soft flattery we whisper 
9207 to ourselves, making us to believe that we are such as the world affects 
9212 For the time, indeed, the ecstasy of this delusion is boundless. Who has 
9213 not, at some one moment or other of his life, experienced the entrancing 
9214 delight of thinking that the world is full of his friends and admirers, 
9218 stand the season of trial. Kate Daiton possessed much to encourage this 
9220 of fascination in her air which a clever French writer defines as the 
9224 struck with them as attractions, recalling the fact of her youth, her 
9225 simplicity, and the freshness of her nature. Above all other charms, 
9226 however, was the radiant happiness that beamed out in every word and 
9228 pleasure in life, is among the very rarest of all gifts. 
9230 There was enough of singularity, of the adventurous, in the nature of 
9231 her position, to excel all the romance of her nature; there was more 
9233 truth to the highest flights of her imagination. Had she been the sole 
9234 daughter of the house and name, flatteries and caresses could not have 
9236 inquired, her taste evoked on every occasion. And yet, with all these 
9240 distasteful. She could still recur to the memory of the little window 
9241 that looked over the “Murg,” and think the scenery beautiful. Her dear, 
9242 dear papa was still all she had ever thought him. Nelly was yet the 
9244 Hanserl was the kind, quaint emblem of his own dreamy “Vaterland.” As 
9245 yet no conflict had arisen between the past and the present, between the 
9246 remembrance of narrow fortune and all its crippling exigencies, and the 
9247 enjoyment of wealth that seems to expand the generous feelings of the 
9249 light over the bygone; would it might have been always so! 
9256 THE great ball at the Mazzarini Palace “came off” just as other great 
9258 There was the usual, perhaps a little more than the usual, splendor of 
9259 dress and diamonds; the same glare and crash and glitter and crowd 
9260 and heat; the same buoyant light-heartedness among the young; the same 
9261 corroding ennui of the old; taste in dress was criticised, looks were 
9264 the ordinary measure of what people call enjoyment, mixed up with the 
9267 jewels; and if the wounds exchanged were not as rudely administered, 
9268 they were to the full as dangerous as in the real lists of combat. 
9270 voluptuous abandonment over everything; and whatever cares they might 
9271 have carried within, as far as appearance went, the world went well and 
9272 pleasantly with them. The ball was, however, a splendid one; there 
9274 decoration; the lighting a perfect blaze. There was beauty in 
9275 abundance, diamonds in masses, and a Royal Highness from the Court, an 
9277 stared at every one, and spoke to nobody. Still he was the centre of 
9278 a glittering group of handsome aides-de-camp, who displayed their 
9281 Apart from the great flood-tide of pleasure, down which so many float 
9282 buoyantly, there is ever on these occasions a deeper current that flows 
9285 beneath the little incidents related to amuse childhood. It would lead 
9286 us too far from the path of our story were we to seek for this “tiny 
9287 thread amid the woof;” enough for our present purpose if we slightly 
9288 advert to it, by asking our reader to accompany us to the small chamber 
9292 arranged a dessert, which, for the season, displayed every charm of 
9293 rarity. A large bouquet of moss-roses and camellias ornamented the 
9294 centre of the board, and shed a pleasant odor through the room. The 
9296 the neighborhood, had just completed all the arrangements of the table, 
9297 placing chairs around it, and heaped fresh wood upon the hearth, when a 
9298 carriage drew up at the door. The merry sound of voices and the step of 
9299 feet were heard on the stairs, and the next moment a lady entered, whose 
9302 this, a black lace veil fastened to the hair behind, and worn across 
9303 the shoulders, contributed. There was a lightness and intrepidity in her 
9304 step, as she entered the room, that suited the dark, flashing, steady 
9306 trace in that almost insolent air of conscious beauty the calm, subdued, 
9308 chapter; but, however dissimilar in appearance, they were the same 
9309 one individual; and the humble femme de chambre of Kate Dalton was the 
9310 celebrated ballet-dancer of the great theatre of Barcelona. 
9315 the habit of a priest, and was in reality a canon of the Dome Cathedral. 
9317 to suffocation by the ascent of the stairs and his cumbrous dress, 
9318 seemed doubly absurd beside the flippant lightness of the “Ballarina.” 
9319  Jekyl came last, mimicking the old canon behind his back, and putting 
9320 the waiter's gravity to a severe test by the bloated expansion of his 
9321 cheek and the fin-like motion of his hands as he went. 
9324 wiped the big drops from his forehead with the skirt of his gown. 
9326 “You tripped up the stairs like a gazelle, padre,” said the girl, as she 
9327 arranged her hair before the glass, and disposed the folds of her veil 
9328 with all the tact of coquetry. 
9330 A thick snort, like the ejaculation a hippopotamus might have uttered, 
9331 was the only reply, and Jekyl, having given a glance over the table to 
9334 “Accursed be the stairs and he that made them!” muttered the padre. “I 
9335 feel as if my limbs had been torn on the rack. I have been three times 
9336 up the steps of the high altar already to-day, and am tired as a dog.” 
9338 “Here is your favorite soup, padre,” said Jekyl, as he moved the ladle 
9342 “And who said I would wish to be young again?” cried the priest, 
9343 angrily. “I have experience of what youth means every day in the 
9344 confessional, and I promise you age has the best of it.” 
9346 “Such a ripe and ruddy age as yours, padre!” said the girl, with 
9352 the tree! Better even that than to be worm-eaten on the stalk; ay, or a 
9355 “You will never be good friends for half an hour together,” said Jekyl, 
9356 as he filled their glasses with champagne, and then touching his own to 
9359 “These are from Savoy, these truffles, and have no flavor,” said the 
9363 “They are like the priests,” said Nina, laughing; “all black without and 
9369 “Yes,” said Nina, languidly. “The dresses were fresher than the wearers. 
9370 It was the first time for much of the satin, the same could not be said 
9371 for many of the company.” 
9377 “And she has eight penances in the week,” grunted out the canon. 
9382 “Angels always are represented as chubby girls,” said the priest, whose 
9385 “Midchekoff, I thought, was out of temper all the evening,” resumed 
9387 the lapis lazuli, or retouches in the pictures; and seemed terribly 
9388 provoked at the goodness of the supper.” 
9391 kept herself disengaged for the prince for half the night, and the only 
9393 past the age of dancing!'” 
9395 “Did the Noncio eat much?” asked the padre, who seemed at once curious 
9396 and envious about the dignitary. 
9403 “The same. You know of that, then, padre?” asked Jekyl. 
9405 A grunt and a nod were all the response. 
9412 of thine, Signor Jekyli, and in the fertile wits of your fair neighbor. 
9413 The unhappy marriages thou hast made; the promising unions thou hast 
9414 broken; the doubts thou hast scattered here, the dark suspicions 
9415 there; the rightful distrust thou hast lulled, the false confidences 
9418 “When I think of the long catalogue of villany you have been listening 
9421 when you have looked out upon the stormy sea of society, as a wrecker 
9422 ranges his eye over an iron-bound coast in a gale, and thinks of the 
9425 become big sins, and, like a skilful angler, throw the little fish back 
9426 into the stream, in the confidence that when full-grown you can take 
9427 them, when you have done all these things and a thousand more, padre, 
9434 point out, but each radically wrong in attributing motives to the other. 
9438 rather a hard case, that, with somewhat better features, and I know a 
9439 far shrewder wit than many others, I should perform second and third 
9441 qualifications are 'cast for the best characters.' This little score I 
9442 do try and exact, not from individuals, but the world at large. Mischief 
9443 with me is the child's pleasure in deranging the chessmen when the 
9444 players are most intent on the game.” 
9446 “Now, as to these Onslows, for we must be practical, padre mio,” said 
9447 Jekyl, “let us see what is to be done with them. As regards matrimony, 
9448 the real prize has left for England, this Dalton girl may or may not be 
9449 a 'hit;' some aver that she is heiress to a large estate, of which the 
9450 Onslows have obtained possession, and that they destine her for the 
9454 “Let her come to 'the Church,' then,” growled out the canon. 
9457 would drag the river always from your own net. We have been generous, 
9458 hugely generous, to you for the last three seasons, and have made all 
9459 your converts the pets of society, no matter how small and insignificant 
9460 their pretensions. The vulgar have been adopted in the best circles, the 
9461 ugly dubbed beautiful, the most tiresome of old maids have been reissued 
9462 from the mint as new coinage. We have petted, flattered, and fawned upon 
9463 those 'interesting Christians,' as the 'Tablet' would call them, till 
9464 the girls began to feel that there were no partners for a polka outside 
9465 the Church of Rome, and that all the 'indulgences' of pleasure, like 
9466 those of religion, came from the Pope. We cannot give you the Onslows, 
9467 or, at least, not yet. We have yet to marry the daughter, provide for 
9468 the friend, squeeze the sou.” 
9470 “Profligate young villain! Reach me the champagne, Nina; and, Nina, tell 
9472 the mid-day mass; that the clergy of the town like to see the equipages 
9473 of the rich before the doors of the cathedral, as a suitable homage to 
9474 the Church. The Onslows have carriages in abundance, and their liveries 
9480 “I hate these simple tastes,” growled out the padre; “they bespeak that 
9487 our choir is magnificent; whisper him that the beautiful Marchesa di 
9488 Guardoni sits on the very bench beside Miss Dalton.” 
9495 “That comes of these English!” cried Nina; “they make our service a 
9497 or relic reverence, or the secrets of the confessional, going on amongst 
9498 them.” 
9500 “Does she permit this?” asked the priest, eagerly. 
9503 to deprecate these attacks, and now and then, when the sallies have been 
9506 “Oh, if these heretics would but abstain from ridicule!” cried the 
9507 canon. “The least lettered amongst them can scoff and gibe and rail. 
9508 They have their stock subjects of sarcasm, too, handed down from father 
9509 to son, poor, witless little blasphemies, thefts from Voltaire, who 
9510 laughed at themselves, and much mischief do they work! Let them begin to 
9511 read, however, let them commence to 'inquire,' as the phrase has it, and 
9512 the game is our own.” 
9518 “Away with you! away with you!” cried the padre, rebukingly. “They 
9519 come to us as the children seek their mother's breast. Hand me the 
9523 less Popish. We have other plots in hand here, besides increasing the 
9524 funds of the 'Holy Carmelites;' and while we are disputing about the 
9525 spoil, the game may betake themselves to other hunting-grounds. These 
9528 “Albert is right,” interposed Nina. “When the 'Midchekoff' condescends 
9529 to think himself in love with the Dalton girl, when the Guardsman has 
9531 half of Florence and bullied the other, then the city will have taken a 
9532 hold upon their hearts, and you may begin your crusade when you please. 
9533 Indeed, I am not sure, if the season be a dull one, I would not listen 
9536 “As you listened once before to the Abbe D'Esmonde,” said the canon, 
9539 The girl's cheek became deep red, and even over neck and shoulders the 
9548 Jekyl motioned the priest to be silent, while, gently leading the other 
9549 into the adjoining room, he drew the curtain, and left her alone. 
9554 “Spare not the sinner, neither let the stripes be light, 'Non sit levis 
9557 “Are the ortolans good, padre?” asked Jekyl, while his eye glittered 
9558 with an intense appreciation of the old canon's hypocrisy. 
9560 “They, are delicious! succulent and tender,” said the priest, wiping his 
9561 lips. “Francesco does them to perfection.” 
9564 to escape the other's notice. 
9566 “She is sobbing still,” said the canon, in a whisper, and with a gesture 
9567 towards the curtained doorway. “I like to hear them gulping down their 
9568 sighs. It is like the glug-glug of a rich flask of 'Lagrime.'” 
9570 “But don't you pity them, padre?” asked Jekyl, in mock earnestness. 
9572 “Never! never! First of all, they do not suffer in all these outbursts. 
9573 It is but decanting their feelings into another vessel, and they love it 
9574 themselves! I have had them for hours together thus in the confessional, 
9575 and they go away after, so relieved in mind and so light of heart, there 
9578 “But Nina,” said Jekyl, seriously, “is not one of these.” 
9580 “She is a woman,” rejoined the padre, “and it is only a priest can read 
9581 them.” 
9583 “You see human nature as the physician does, padre, always in some 
9587 “True in one sense, boy; ours are the stony paths, ours are the weary 
9590 “It 's very pleasant, padre. It is part of a case I ordered for the 
9591 Onslows, but their butler shook the bottle when bringing it to table, 
9592 and they begged me to get rid of it.” 
9594 “These wines are not suited to Italy generally,” said the canon; “but 
9595 Florence has the merit of possessing all climates within the bounds of 
9596 a single day, and even Chambertin is scarcely generous enough when the 
9600 Nina, appearing at the doorway. 
9602 “'Venga pure! Venga pure!'” growled out the canon. “I forgive thee 
9605 “There, then, let this be a peace-offering,” said she, taking the wreath 
9606 of flowers from her own head and placing it on the brows of the padre. 
9607 “You are now like the old Bacchus in the Boboli.” 
9614 have met for other objects than to exchange reproaches.” 
9616 “These are but the 'iras amantium.' boy,” said the priest; “the girl 
9622 “Lectiones pravissimae would they be!” muttered he, between his teeth. 
9624 “What is that? What is he mumbling there, Albert?” cried she, hastily. 
9626 “It is a benediction, Nina,” replied Jekyl; “did you not hear the 
9629 Peace was at last restored, and what between the adroit devices of Jekyl 
9630 and the goodness of his champagne, a feeling of pleasant sociality now 
9631 succeeded to all the bickering in which the festivity was prolonged to 
9632 a late hour. The graver business which brought them together the Onslows 
9633 and their affairs being discussed, they gave way to all the seductions 
9634 of their exalted fancies. Jekyl, taking up his guitar, warbled out a 
9636 Nina, with the aid of the padre's beads for castanets, stepped the 
9637 measure of a bolero; while the old priest himself broke out into a long 
9639 figured, and under the influence of which he fell fast asleep at last, 
9640 totally unconscious of the corked moustaches and eyebrows with which 
9643 The sound of wheels in the silent street at last admonished them of 
9644 the hour, and opening the window, Jekyl saw a brougham belonging to Sir 
9645 Stafford just drawing up at the door. 
9651 toward the priest; “he does not live far away.” 
9657 worth.” And so saying, Jekyl proceeded to arrange the disordered dress 
9658 and dishevelled hair of the padre, during the performance of which the 
9660 led downstairs and deposited in the carriage. 
9663 little French bed, over which the rose-colored mosquito curtains threw 
9665 dreams the dreams of a happy and contented nature he wove pleasant 
9668 In his own dreary little den, behind the “Duomo,” the padre also slept 
9669 heavily, not a thought, not a single passing idea breaking the stagnant 
9674 habitually modest braid; her very features composing themselves, as she 
9675 did so, into their wonted aspect of gentleness and submission. 
9677 All the change of dress being little in comparison with the complete 
9680 to the world, we completely forget that we share in the deception 
9688 IT was past midnight, the Opera was just over, and the few privileged 
9689 guests who were permitted to pay their visits to Lady Hester Onslow 
9690 were assembled in the little drawing-room and boudoir sacred to these 
9691 exclusive receptions. Nothing could be in stronger contrast than the 
9692 gorgeous splendor of the apartment and the half-dressed, careless, 
9693 lounging ease of the men as they stretched themselves on the ottomans, 
9694 lounged on the sofas, or puffed their cigars, alike indifferent to the 
9695 place and the presence of two ladies who, dressed in the very perfection 
9696 of “toilette,” did the honors of the reception. 
9699 on one side of the head, and a species of velvet jacket, such as is 
9701 with lace; a most splendidly ornamented hooka, the emerald mouthpiece of 
9704 chairs, on cushions, squabs, “Prie-Dieu” and other drawing-room devices 
9706 pronounced them long habituated to all the usages of society. One stamp 
9708 and weary-looking, they seemed as though they were tired of a life of 
9709 dissipation, and yet utterly incapable of engaging in any other. 
9711 All born to high rank, some to large fortune, they found that no other 
9712 career was open to them except vice in one shape or other. The policy 
9713 of their rulers had excluded them from every road of honorable ambition; 
9714 neither as statesmen nor soldiers could they hope to win fame or glory. 
9715 Their habits of life and the tone of society gave no impulse to the 
9716 cultivation of science or literature. The topics discussed in their 
9717 circle never by chance adverted to a book; and there they were, with 
9720 away life in the dullest imaginable routine of dissipation, their minds 
9721 neglected, their hearts corrupted, enervated in body, and deprived of 
9722 all energy of character; they wore, even in youth, the exhausted look of 
9723 age, and bore in every lineament of their features the type of lassitude 
9726 In the adjoining room sat Kate Dalton at a tea-table. She was costumed 
9728 whose length of stomacher and deep-hanging sleeves recalled the 
9729 portraits of Titian's time; a small cap covered the back of her head, 
9730 through an aperture in which the hair appeared, its rich auburn masses 
9732 with precious stones; a massive gold chain, with a heavy cross of the 
9733 same metal, was the only ornament she wore. Widely different as was the 
9734 dress from that humble guise in which the reader first knew her, the 
9735 internal change was even greater still; no longer the bashful, blushing 
9736 girl, beaming with all the delight of a happy nature, credulous, 
9738 gentle-mannered; the placid smile that moved her lips, the graceful 
9741 attraction secondary to the fascination of her manner. It is true the 
9743 with a look of full and fearless confidence: the cordial warmth, the 
9744 fresh and buoyant sallies of her ready wit, had departed, and in their 
9746 a quiet but watchful spirit of repartee, that flattered by the very 
9750 more beautiful now than before; that intercourse with the world, dress, 
9751 manners, the tact of society, the stimulus of admiration, the assured 
9752 sense of her own charms, however they may have detracted from the moral 
9754 more striking fascinations. Her walk, her courtesy, the passing motion 
9757 and elegance. Two persons were seated near her: one of these, our old 
9758 acquaintance, George Onslow; the other was a dark, sallow-visaged man, 
9760 his features were marked by the hard lines of time, his figure had all 
9761 the semblance of youth. By a broad blue ribbon round his neck he wore 
9762 the decoration of Saint Nicholas, and the breast of his coat was covered 
9763 with stars, crosses, and orders of half the courts of Europe. This was 
9764 Prince Midchekoff, whose grandfather, having taken an active part in 
9765 the assassination of the Emperor Paul, had never been reconciled to 
9766 the Imperial family, and was permitted to reside in a kind of honorable 
9769 and there was scarcely a capital of Europe in which he did not possess 
9770 a residence. The character of his face was peculiar, for while the 
9771 forehead and eyes were intellectual and candid, the lower jaw and mouth 
9773 cruelty being the impression at once conveyed by the thin, straight, 
9774 compressed lips, and the long, projecting chin, seeming even longer 
9775 from the black-pointed beard he wore. There was nothing vulgar or 
9777 and yet he was equally far from the type of high birth. His manners 
9779 attentive air and his easy smile showed he possessed the still rarer 
9782 There was another figure, not exactly of this group, but at a little 
9784 and drawings were scattered, and in the contemplation of which he 
9787 singularly handsome man, in the dress of a priest. His hair, black and 
9789 were deep-set, and around the orbits ran lines that told of long and 
9790 hard study, for the Abbe D'Esmonde was a distinguished scholar; and, as 
9791 a means of withdrawing him for a season from the overtoil of reading, 
9793 the Mission of the “Nonce.” In this guise he was admitted into all the 
9794 society of the capital, where his polished address and gentle manner 
9797 Equally removed from the flippant levity of the abbe as a class, and 
9798 the gross and sensual coarseness of the “old priest,” D'Esmonde was a 
9799 perfect man of the world, so far as taking a lively interest in all the 
9800 great events of politics, watching eagerly the changeful features of the 
9801 times, and studying acutely the characters of the leading men, at whose 
9802 dictates they were modified. Its pleasures and amusements, too, he was 
9806 the great dignitaries who wear scarlet and purple stockings are often 
9808 to principle; others called it hypocrisy; and some, again, perhaps with 
9809 more truth, deemed it the settled line of action of one who already 
9814 been admitted to receptions like the present; but Jekyl, who managed 
9815 everything, had invited him, on the principle, as he said, that a 
9817 drink, but because it looks temperate.” The abbe's presence had the same 
9820 character for the rest. 
9822 At the tea-table the conversation languished, or only went forward at 
9824 shame. Kate felt that she ought not to take the lead; and the Prince, 
9825 habitually reserved, spoke very little, and even that in the discursive, 
9827 topic he started should be instantly adopted by the company. 
9831 unabashed the glance of searching, almost insolent meaning he bestowed 
9833 were calm and passionless; nor did she in the slightest degree show any 
9834 consciousness of a manner that was costing Onslow a struggle whether to 
9837 In one sense these two men were rivals, but each so impressed with 
9838 proud contempt for the other, their rivalry was unknown to both. Kate, 
9840 smile or slightest word inclined the balance to this side or to that. 
9841 The Prince was inveighing against the habit of wintering in Italy as one 
9842 of the most capital blunders of the age. 
9845 first and nature second, as we see evidenced in all the results of 
9846 agriculture. It is not the most fertile soil, but the highest-labored 
9847 one which produces the best fruits. So with respect to climate, we never 
9851 spend the dog-days at Calcutta,” said Kate, smiling. 
9853 “So we should,” replied he; “the appliances to resist heat or cold, of 
9854 man's invention, are far better adapted to enjoyment than the accidental 
9857 “In my country,” said Onslow, tartly, “men study less how to avoid the 
9858 inclemencies of weather than to become indifferent to them. Hunting, 
9861 The Prince paid no attention to the remark, but turned the conversation 
9862 into another channel, by asking Kate if she had ever read Fourier's 
9863 book. From this he wandered away to the characteristic differences 
9864 of national music, thence to the discoveries then making in Central 
9865 America, and lastly, engaged her in an animated discussion of the 
9866 question of slavery. On none of these points was he deeply or even well 
9870 that secured attention. Not, indeed, from George Onslow; he was the most 
9871 bored of men. None of the topics were his topics. Of Tattersall's, the 
9872 Guards' Club, the society of London, the odds on the “Derby,” he could 
9873 have discoursed well and pleasantly. From what was “wrong” with the 
9875 could have told you everything; but all these other themes were, in his 
9876 estimation, but sheer pedantry, and, indeed, they only lacked a little 
9879 “He is gone,” said the Prince, with a caustic smile which revealed a 
9882 “So, then, this was a device of yours, Prince,” said she, laughing. “I 
9886 my victory. Let me speak to you on another subject.” He drew his chair 
9887 a little nearer to the table as he spoke, and laid his arm on it. Kate's 
9888 heart beat fast and full; and the color came and went rapidly in her 
9890 at conflict within her. There was but one theme in the world that 
9892 purpose-like. Was this, then, possible? 
9897 her father, of Nelly, of Frank; and, lastly, what thoughts of George, 
9899 was not altogether indifferent. “Do not be agitated, Mademoiselle,” said 
9900 the prince, laying the slightest touch of his jewelled fingers on her 
9904 “Is that really like an Irish peasant's cottage, Miss Daiton?” said the 
9905 abbe, as he held before her a drawing of one, in all the details of its 
9908 “Yes, perfectly; not exaggerated in the least,” said she, hurriedly 
9909 blushing alike at the surprise and the interruption. 
9912  remarked the priest, with a courteous bend of the head. 
9915 that no man forgets his station,” said the prince, with an insolent 
9917 stood calm and passionless under the sarcasm. 
9922 “You have been at Wredna?” asked the Prince, in an altered voice. 
9924 But the other, not heeding the interruption, went on: 
9927 illustrates the rigid obedience yielded to power, and the condition of 
9928 public opinion at the same time. A manumitted slave, who was raised to 
9929 high rank and wealth by the favor of the Czar, had returned to Wredna 
9930 in the capacity of governor. A short time after his arrival he was 
9932 who asserted that she was his mother. Fedeorovna, of course in secret, 
9933 proved the truth of her assertion; but the only answer she received was 
9935 which could only prove offensive. Perhaps incredulous of the authentic 
9937 she carried the humble basket of fruit and vegetables that she hawked 
9938 for a livelihood before the door of the great mansion where her son 
9939 resided; but, instead of advertising her wares, as is customary in these 
9941 she carried a little placard, with the inscription, 'The Mother of 
9942 Alexovitch,' the name of the Governor. A crowd soon gathered around this 
9944 the police resorted to the spot, and carried the offender before the 
9945 judge. The defence was the simple one that she had merely averred the 
9946 truth. I need not weary you with the mockery of investigation that 
9947 followed; the result is all I need tell. This woman was knouted and sent 
9948 away to Siberia. So much for the Governor. As for the governed, they 
9952 “Do you tell the story as a fact, sir?” said the Prince, whose dark 
9955 “I tell it distinctly as a fact. The Papa who received the woman's 
9956 confession repeated the tale on his own deathbed, from whence it reached 
9959 “Priests can be liars, whether Greek or Roman,” said the Prince, in a 
9960 voice almost suffocated with passion; and then, suddenly checking the 
9965 “I will furnish you with all the names to-morrow, Monsieur le Prince,” 
9966  said D'Esmonde, in a whisper; and sauntered away into the adjoining 
9969 “You look pale, Miss Dalton,” said the Prince. 
9981 There was a degree of solemnity in the way he uttered these words that 
9984 awakened to the conviction that its calm waters covered rocks and 
9986 amiabilities be dangerous acquaintances? Was there poison in this 
9987 charmed cup? Was the doubt which sprang to her mind But she had not time 
9988 for the inquiry, as the Prince offered her his arm to the supper-room. 
9995 IN our penal settlements nothing is more common than to find the places 
9997 may date the favorable turn of their fortune to the day of their having 
9998 transgressed the law. So in certain Continental cities are individuals 
10000 of influence, whose misdeeds at home first made them exiles, and who, 
10002 difference between the two cases; for while the convict owes all his 
10003 future advancement to his own efforts at reformation, the absentee 
10004 obtains his “brevet” of character by the simple fact of his extradition.

10007 upon the shores of Ostend or Boulogne. 
10010 the undistinguishable herd of vulgar folk. He must belong to some family 
10013 legislature. We have been led to these reflections by having to 
10014 chronicle the arrival in Florence of Lord Norwood; a vague and confused 
10017 sorrow for him; others said he was a capital fellow, up to everything, 
10018 and that they were delighted at his coming. A few, of very tender and 
10019 languishing virtue themselves, wondered if they ought to meet him as 
10020 before; but the prevailing impression was charitable. The affair 
10021 at Graham's might have been exaggerated, the Newmarket business was 
10025 privilege, the noble Viscount here enjoyed it at the hands of a jury 
10026 unimpeachable on the score of equality. 
10032 “No man plays ecarte better,” said Haggerstone, while as yet the 
10033 Viscount's arrival was unknown, and as he discussed the rumors upon him 
10034 before a group of listening Englishmen at the door of the “Club”. “No 
10036 that was intended to convey a meaning beyond the mere words. 
10038 “Has he been a large winner, then?” asked one of the bystanders, 
10039 respectfully, looking to the Colonel for information; for, in a certain 
10040 set, he was regarded as the most thoroughly conversant man with all the 
10044 he, always happy at the opportunity to quote the name of a man of 
10047 “That was the Mo-Mo-Morris that ruined Hopeton, was n't it?” broke in 
10048 Purvis, quite forgetting that the individual he addressed was reported 
10049 to have a share in the transaction. Haggerstone, however, did not deign 
10053 He is English, certainly; that frock has a London cut there's no 
10057 spoke, from the group. Meanwhile, the noble Viscount, a well-dressed, 
10066 “Or you wouldn't be here, Haggy, eh?” said the Viscount, laughing at his 
10073  said the other, with a heartier laugh, which, despite of the Colonel's 
10076 “Is there any play going on, Haggy?” 
10079 points, a little ecarte, a little piquet, and, now and then, we have a 
10082 “Poor old fellow! and he 's alive still? And where 's the Jariominski?” 
10090 “And that little Frenchman what was his name? his father was a Marshal 
10091 of the Empire.” 
10103 “What a pity! So they 're all broken up, I see.” 
10107 “Then what have you got in their place?” 
10109 “Nothing fast, my Lord, except, perhaps, your friends the Onslows.” 
10111 “Yes; they 're going it, I hear. Is n't there a rich niece, or cousin, 
10112 or something of that sort, with them?” 
10116 in a state of the very closest poverty.” 
10118 “And Master George, how does he carry on the war?” said the Viscount, 
10119 who seemed quite heedless of the other's correction. 
10121 “He plays a little peddling ecarte now and then; but you can see that he 
10122 has burned his fingers, and dreads the fire. They say he 's in love with 
10123 the Dalton girl.” 
10125 “Of course he is, if they live in the same house; and he 's just the 
10129 “Purvis, my Lord; don't you remember him? He's one of the Ricketts's 
10136 and gasped till he grew black in the face. 
10138 “What's the word? Give it him, Haggy. It's all up with him,” said the 
10145 “Confound it, man, can't you be satisfied? when you're once over the 
10146 fence, you need n't go back to leap it. And how is the dear what's her 
10147 name Agathe? no, Zoe, how is she?” 
10153 “In the Vill-ino, my Lord, you mean?” 
10155 “Egad! she seems the only thing left; like the dog on the wreck, eh, 
10158 “Just so, my Lord,” said the other, with a complacent laugh. 
10160 “What a mass of old crockery she must have got together by this 
10161 time!” said the Viscount, yawning with a terrible recollection of her 
10166 “Pretty well, for a man that they call ru-ru-ruined,” said Purvis, 
10169 Norwood turned a look of angry indignation at him, and then, as if 
10170 seeing the unworthiness of the object, merely said, 
10172 “A yacht is the only real economy nowadays. You get rid at once of all 
10173 trains of servants, household, stable people; even the bores of your 
10175 at Haggerstone, he passed across the street, in time to overtake Onslow, 
10178 “I think I ga-ga-gave it him there,” cried Purvis, with an hysteric 
10180 never cared how severely he was himself riddled by the enemy's fire. 
10181 Meanwhile, the Viscount and his friend were hastening forward to the 
10185 We may take this opportunity to mention, that when the rumors which 
10188 for the Viscount, declared himself in the very strongest terms on the 
10189 subject of his offending, and took especial pains to show the marked 
10193 It was in vain he was told that the rigid rule of English morality is 
10194 always relaxed abroad, and that the moral latitude is very different in 
10196 is the same in all climates; and having received from England a very 
10197 detailed and specific history of the noble Lord's misdoings, he firmly 
10200 With all George Onslow's affection and respect for his father, he could 
10201 not help feeling that this was a mere prejudice, one of the lingering 
10205 be acted on? What man or, further still, what woman of fashionable life 
10208 patriarchal simplicity; and, even there, what security was there against 
10209 ignoble offendings? How should, he stand the ridicule of his club and 
10211 arguments were strengthened by his disbelief, or rather his repugnance 
10212 to believe the worst of Norwood; and furthermore, supported by Lady 
10214 that the Viscount should be received, by her, at least. Exactly as of 
10216 now leaning to this side, now inclining to that when the question was 
10218 for, as he loitered along the street, he suddenly felt an arm introduced 
10220 his customary coolness, asked after each member of the family, and at 
10221 once proposed to pay them a visit. 
10227 be explained away. Perhaps, after all, the thing is a mere trifle; and 
10228 if he were to take the decided line of cutting a man without due cause, 
10229 the consequences might be most injurious. These, and fifty such-like 
10233 thoughts, George came to the resolution of finding out at once the 
10234 precise position in which Norwood stood, and to this end asked the last 
10242 and I myself have not escaped. In fact, George, the 'Legs' have had it 
10243 all their own way. I suppose you heard something about it out here?” 
10245 “Why, yes; there were reports--” 
10249 kinds of stories. But the facts are simple enough.” 
10251 “I 'm heartily glad you say so; for, to tell you the truth, Norwood, my 
10252 father is one of the prejudiced about this affair, and I 'm dying to be 
10253 able to give him a full explanation of the whole.” 
10255 “Ah, Sir Stafford, too, among the credulous!” said Norwood, slowly. “I 
10257 was not exactly the person to form hasty conclusions against any man's 
10259 condescend to explain to any one but you the thing is a very simple 
10260 one. There was a mare of Hopeton's, a Brockdon filly, entered for the 
10262 against the field. A bold coup always, George, that backing against 
10263 the field. Never do it, my boy, and particularly when you 've a set of 
10265 George; the downiest coves ever you met, and who, in their confounded 
10268 you again; but no treachery, no stab in the dark. Oh, no, no! The turf 
10269 in England was another thing before these Continental rascals came 
10270 amongst us. I was always against admitting them within the ring. I 
10271 black-balled a dozen of them at the Club. But see what perseverance 
10272 does; they're all in now. There's no John-Bull feeling among our 
10274 fellows, George. Out of England there is no truth, no honor. But, above 
10275 all, don't back against the field; there are so many dodges against you; 
10277 the way I got it so heavily; for when Ruxton came and told me that 
10279 trifle, you know; and there was a swelling as large as my hand around 
10280 the coronet. The foreign fellows can manage that in the morning, and 
10281 the horse will run to win the same day. I saw it myself. Ah, John 
10284 dare to insinuate anything to my discredit, I 'll never give myself the 
10287 him out at once, George; parade him on the spot, my boy; that 's the 
10288 only plan. What! is this your quarter?” asked he, as they stopped at the 
10289 entrance of the spacious palace. “I used to know this house well of old. 
10290 It was the Embassy in Templeton's time. Very snug it used to be. Glad to 
10292 the staircase, and got rid of that tiresome tapestry, too. Pretty 
10293 vases those; fresh-looking that conservatory, they 're always strong in 
10294 camellias in Florence. This used to be the billiard-room. I think you've 
10296 excellent taste that chintz furniture; just the thing for Italy, and 
10299 “I'll see if my Lady be visible,” said George, as he threw the “Morning 
10300 Post” to his friend, and hastily quitted the chamber. 
10303 survey of the apartment, in the course of which his attention was 
10306 Kate Dalton. There was something in the character of her beauty an air 
10309 his own features the proud expression of the portrait. 
10312 and yet not do badly, either,” said he to himself; and then, as if 
10314 he turned over the visiting-cards to see the names of the current 
10315 acquaintance: “Midchekoff, Estrolenka, Janini, Tiverton, Latrobe, the 
10316 old set; the Ricketts, too, and Haggerstone. What can have brought them 
10317 here? Oh, there must have been a ball, for here are shoals of outsiders, 
10318 the great Smith-Brown-and-Thompson community; and here, on the very 
10319 smallest of pasteboards, in the very meekest of literals, have we our 
10321  said Norwood, as he threw himself back on the comfortable depth of a 
10325 hastened to Sir Stafford's apartment to tell him how completely the 
10328 the explanation, nor could trace anything like connection between the 
10329 disjointed links of the narrative. He could only affirm his own perfect 
10331 his father. Fortunately for his powers of persuasiveness, they were not 
10334 followed, in the hope of overtaking him. 
10336 Lady Hester was already dressed, and about to enter the drawing-room, 
10337 when George told her that Norwood was there; and yet she returned to 
10340 time, and afford her an interval for thoughts which, whatever their 
10343 It is an awkward thing, at any time, to meet with the person to whom you 
10344 once believed you should have been married; to see, on the terms of mere 
10345 common acquaintance, the individual with whose fate and fortune you at 
10347 for better or for worse. To exchange the vapid commonplaces of the 
10348 world; to barter the poor counters of that petty game called society, 
10349 with her or him with whom you have walked in all the unbounded 
10354 in happy fancies; to stand, as it were, and trace out with the eye some 
10355 path in life we might have followed, wondering whither it would have 
10359 the follies that have misled and the faults that have wrecked us! Such 
10360 are among the inevitable reminiscences of meeting; and they are full of 
10361 a soft and touching sorrow, not all unpleasing, either, as they remind 
10362 us of our youth and its buoyancy. Far otherwise was the present case. 
10363 Whatever might have been the bold confidence with which Lady Hester 
10365 the man refuted the assertion. She knew thoroughly that he was perfectly 
10369 had long seen; and perhaps the unhappy moment had come when even this 
10371 sense of the man, would it be believed she had once loved him! ay, with 
10375 His own indifference had done something, her new relations with the 
10377 a degree of half terror that there lived one man who had so thoroughly 
10378 read all the secrets of her heart, and knew every sentiment of her 
10382 the gambols of a little Blenheim spaniel, whose silver collar bore the 
10383 coronet of the Russian prince. He never perceived Lady Hester until she 
10391 She withdrew it languidly, and seating herself, not upon the sofa to 
10398 “Had you pleasant weather?” 
10400 “After we got clear of the Channel, excellent weather.” 
10409 Norwood colored a little at a question the drift of which he felt 
10412 “Are they in England? I thought I read their names at the Newmarket 
10415 “Yes; they were both at Newmarket,” replied he, shortly. 
10422 “I heard so,” was the short reply; and in a tone so dry and significant 
10425 “Pretty spaniel, that,” said Norwood, trying a slight sortie into the 
10431 seen much of the Prince?” 
10433 “He comes here every evening, after the Opera.” 
10443 “And yet you look the same the very same as when we sauntered for hours 
10444 through the old woods at Dipsley.” She blushed deeply; less, perhaps, at 
10445 the words, than at the look which accompanied them. 
10448 to the portrait of Kate Dal ton. 
10458 Princess, a Duchessa of Italy, or the goodwife of an untitled 
10461 “She may have her choice, I believe, of either of the three--.” 
10474 your old manner, this not exactly the reception I looked for. Now, if 
10477 are silent, so there is something; pray let's hear it.” 
10485 There was something in the cold and steady gaze he bestowed upon her 
10486 that abashed, if not actually alarmed, Lady Hester. She had seen the 
10487 same look once or twice before, and always as the prelude to some 
10491 though he would not have her lose a word he spoke, “the explanation 
10492 which a man would ask for at the peril of his life ought not, in common 
10494 you may not care for the price, be it so; only I warn you that if you 
10495 wish for any information on the subject you allude to, _I_ will inquire 
10496 whether--” 
10503 Never was any man less in the humor to provoke hostilities, and 
10504 particularly from old friends. I have just had bad luck, the very worst 
10508 any other living, more, perhaps, than I ought even to you.” 
10522 “I may be unequal to the task.” 
10526 “I have tried, Norwood. I have gone the length of declaring that I 
10527 disbelieved every story against you, that I reposed the most implicit 
10536 into a mess, the worst of all the bad scrapes which have ever befallen 
10540 to live 'within the rules.' Let me, at least, have the benefit of the 
10541 protection for condescending to the locality.” 
10543 “Sir Stafford, my Lady,” said a servant, throwing open the door; and 
10544 the old Baronet entered hastily, and, without deigning to notice Lord 
10548 Affecting to occupy himself with the books upon the table, Norwood 
10549 watched the dialogue with keen but stealthy glances, and then, as the 
10550 other turned suddenly round, said, 
10557 “You are surprised to see me in Florence, for certain,” said the other, 
10560 “Very much surprised to see you here, my Lord,” was the abrupt reply. 
10563 to feel the point of the remark. “But, nowadays, one flits about the 
10568 letters this morning, written this day week, and which give the last 
10569 events in Town Life up to the very hour.” 
10571 “Indeed! and what's the news, then?” said he, negligently. 
10574 I may be able to enlighten you,” said Sir Stafford, moving towards the 
10577 “With the greatest pleasure. Good-bye, Lady Hester,” said he, rising. 
10583 “Now, Sir Stafford, I 'm at your orders,” said the Viscount, gayly, 
10584 as he left the room, followed by the old man, whose crimson cheek and 
10585 flashing eye bespoke the passion which was struggling within him. 
10587 Of the two who now entered Sir Stafford's library, it must be owned that 
10588 Lord Norwood was, by many degrees, the more calm and collected. No one, 
10591 his eyes over the well-filled shelves and the hand some fittings of 
10592 the chamber, nothing could be more naturally spoken than the few 
10595 “I shall not ask you to be seated, my Lord,” said the old Baronet, whose 
10598 too painful to either of us, nor could we desire to prolong them. To me, 
10599 I own, they are very, very painful.” 
10602 searched for a letter among a number of others that littered the table. 
10605 back to the fire, and waited in patience. 
10607 “I have, I fear, mislaid the letter,” said Sir Stafford, whose nervous 
10608 anxiety had now so completely mastered him that he threw the letters and 
10611 The Viscount made no sign, but suffered the search to proceed without 
10614 “It was a letter from Lord Effingdale,” continued the Baronet, still 
10615 busied in the pursuit, “a letter written after the Newmarket settling, 
10619 Lord Norwood gave another bow, slighter and colder than the former, as 
10622 “Ah! here it is! here it is!” cried Sir Stafford, at last detecting the 
10625 certain defalcations on your part, the members of the 'Whip Club' 
10626 have erased your Lordship's name from their list, and declared you 
10627 incapacitated from either entering a horse, or naming a winner for the 
10628 stakes in future. There, there, my Lord, is the paragraph, coupled with 
10629 what you will doubtless feel to be a very severe but just comment on the 
10632 Norwood took the letter and read it leisurely, as leisurely and calmly 
10633 as though the contents never concerned him, and then, folding it up, 
10634 laid it on the chimney-piece beside him. 
10637 considering that his mother was a governess. He writes 'naming' with an 
10640 But as Sir Stafford paid no attention to the criticism, he went on: 
10642 “As to the 'Whip,' I may as well tell you, that I scratched my own name 
10644 three others of the same brilliant stamp, not a gentleman amongst them.” 
10648 “If you mean to ask whether a man always wins at Doncaster or Newmarket, 
10649 the question is of the easiest to answer.” 
10652  replied Sir Stafford, coloring at the evasive impertinence of the other. 
10655 essential condition, for the 'Turf' is not precisely like a mercantile 
10658 Sir Stafford winced under the flippant insolence with which this was 
10663 betting man is, therefore, in a position quite exceptional.” 
10668 “I see that you cannot enter into a theme so very different from all 
10669 your habits and pursuits. You think there is a kind of bankruptcy when 
10670 a man gets a little behind with his bets. You don't see that all these 
10672 'book up' another time. There was George, your own son--” 
10675 grasp of the chair, while the color fled from his cheek, and he seemed 
10678 “Oh, nothing in the world to cause you uneasiness. A more honorable 
10679 fellow never breathed than George.” 
10684 And the old man shook like one in an ague; but Norwood saw his 
10685 vantage-ground, and determined to use it unsparingly. He therefore 
10687 there is nothing worthy of a moment's chagrin. I was only about to 
10688 observe that if I had the same taste for scandal-writing as poor Effy, 
10690 left England, owing me a good round sum, for which, by the way, I was 
10691 terribly 'hard up;' and although the money was paid eventually, what 
10692 would you have thought of me what would the world have thought of him if 
10696 anger, in which, as if carried away, he snatched the letter from the 
10697 chimney-piece and threw it into the fire. The act was unseen by Sir 
10699 faint groan alone bespeaking the secret agony of his heart. 
10701 “My son has, then, paid you? He owes nothing, my Lord?” said he, at 
10704 “Like a trump!” said Norwood, assuming the most easy and self-satisfied 
10706 the field anywhere! A true John Bull! no humbug, no nonsense about him! 
10709 “Your position is, then, this, my Lord,” said Sir Stafford, whose 
10712 have not the remotest prospect of liquidation.” 
10714 “Too fast, you go too fast!” said the Viscount, laughing. 
10716 “Lord Effingdale writes the amount at thirty thousand pounds, and adds 
10719 “There's the whole of it,” broke in Norwood. “You ring the changes 
10720 about that one confounded word, and there is no use in attempting a 
10721 vindication. 'Give a dog a bad name,' as the adage says. Now, I took the 
10722 trouble this very morning to go over the whole of this tiresome business 
10725 cannot always 'ride the winner; 'I 'm sure I wish _I_ could. Of course, 
10727 and live in such a place as this, and just at the opening of the season, 
10729 'when a certain gent sits on the coach-box.'” 
10731 Sir Stafford stood, during the whole of this speech, with his arms 
10732 folded and his eyes fixed upon the floor. He never heard one word of 
10737 the feelings of those who engage in them, and of the rules of honor by 
10738 which they are guided; but this I know, that the man whom his equals 
10743 “This would be a very rude speech, Sir Stafford Onslow, even with the 
10745 equality between us. I am the least bellicose of men, I believe I can 
10746 say I may afford to be so. So long, therefore, as you confine such 
10747 sentiments to yourself, I will never complain of them; but if the time 
10748 comes that you conceive they should be issued for general circulation--” 
10750 “Well, my Lord, what then?” 
10753 himself up, and fixed his eye steadily on the distant wall of the room, 
10754 with a look and gesture that made the old man sick at heart. Norwood saw 
10756 I conclude, has lasted quite long enough for either of us. If you have 
10757 any further explanations to seek for, let them come through a younger 
10760 Sir Stafford bowed, without speaking, as the other passed out. 
10762 To have seen them both at that moment, few would have guessed aright on 
10763 which side lay all the disgrace, and where the spirit of rectitude and 
10766 Sir Stafford, indeed, was most miserable. If the Viscount's mock 
10768 possible they might have sufficed with others more conversant with such 
10769 matters? Perhaps he is not worse than others of his own class. What 
10772 different forms, each of them enough to appall him. “But the man is 
10773 a defaulter; he has fled from England with 'shame,'” was the stubborn 
10774 conviction which no efforts of his casuistry could banish; and the more 
10775 he reflected on this, the less possible seemed anything like evasion or 
10784 itself, was destined to exercise a very important influence upon the 
10785 fortunes of the Onslow family. The interview between Sir Stafford and 
10786 the Viscount scarcely occupied five minutes; after which the Baronet 
10790 ominous kind of silence pervaded the house. The few privileged visitors 
10793 a haughty sense of triumph. Even the humbler menials appeared to feel 
10794 that something had occurred, and betrayed in their anxious faces some 
10795 resemblance to that vague sense of half-curiosity, half-terror, the 
10797 they know nothing, has occurred to the machinery. 
10799 Their doubts and suspicions assumed more shape when the order came that 
10800 Sir Stafford would dine in the library, and her Ladyship in her own 
10801 room, George Onslow alone appearing in the dining-room. There was an air 
10802 of melancholy over everything, the silence deepening as night came on. 
10803 Servants went noiselessly to and fro, drew the curtains, and closed 
10804 the doors with a half-stealthy gesture, and seemed as though fearful of 
10807 We neither have, nor desire to have, secrets from our readers. We will 
10808 therefore proceed to Sir Stafford's dressing-room, where the old Baronet 
10809 sat moodily over the fire, his anxious features and sorrow-struck 
10810 expression showing the ravages even a few hours of suffering had 
10811 inflicted. His table was littered with papers, parchments, and other 
10812 formidable-looking documents. Some letters lay sealed here, others were 
10813 half-written there; everything about him showed the conflict of doubt 
10815 painful struggle was maintained there. 
10817 For some time back he had seen with displeasure the course of 
10818 extravagance and waste of all his household. He had observed the habits 
10821 would be made with the coming summer, he had forborne to advert to 
10824 anxiety presented itself, in the class of intimates admitted by Lady 
10825 Hester to her society. Of the foreigners he knew comparatively 
10826 little; but that little was not to their advantage. Some were wealthy 
10827 voluptuaries, glad to propagate their own habits of extravagance among 
10828 those they suspected of fortunes smaller than their own. Others were 
10830 their profit. All were men of pleasure, and of that indolent, lounging, 
10832 active lives, and been always immersed in the cares and interests of 
10836 the very worst acquaintances for Kate, in whom already he was deeply 
10838 could be detected in their fame, till the arrival of Lord Norwood added 
10839 his name to the list. 
10845 adverting to what had passed between the Viscount and himself, the 
10849 warmth on both sides, till Sir Stafford palpably hinted at the possible 
10851 to conjugal welfare. Her Ladyship caught up the suggestion with avidity, 
10853 there was none in writing the word, “Separation.” 
10855 If the thought had already familiarized itself to his mind, the word had 
10856 not; and strange it is that the written syllables should have a power 
10857 and meaning that the idea itself could never realize. 
10859 To men who have had little publicity in their lives, and that little 
10860 always of an honorable nature, there is no thought so poignantly 
10861 miserable as the dread of a scandalous notoriety. To associate their 
10862 names with anything that ministers to gossip; to make them tea-table 
10863 talk; still worse, to expose them to sneering and impertinent 
10864 criticisms, by revealing the secrets of their domesticity, is a torture 
10867 sight of his name in the list of directors of some great enterprise, as 
10868 the patron of a charity, the governor of an hospital, or the donor to an 
10870 without a sense of shrinking delicacy; but to become the mark for public 
10871 discussion in the relations of his private life, to have himself and his 
10872 family brought up to the bar of that terrible ordeal, where bad tongues 
10873 are the eloquent, and evil speakers are the witty, was a speculation 
10878 truly associate all those virtues that take their origin in refinement 
10880 to which a man, the very hardiest and least shamefaced, would succumb, 
10882 bashfulness, can be so hardened by the world that she can face a 
10887 one stage of the road. She had abundant examples around her of those 
10888 best received and best looked on in society, whose chief claim to the 
10889 world's esteem seemed to be the contempt with which they treated all its 
10890 ordinances. There was a dash of heroism in their effrontery that pleased 
10892 other people; their increased liberty seemed to impart enlarged and more 
10893 generous views, and they were always “good-natured,” since, living in 
10894 the very glassiest of houses, they never “shied” a pebble. 
10896 While, then, Sir Stafford sat overwhelmed with shame and sorrow at the 
10897 bare thought of the public discussion that awaited him, Lady Hester was 
10898 speculating upon condolences here, approbation there, panegyrics upon 
10901 upon the strange unsuitableness of her marriage with a man so much her 
10903 Besides and perhaps the greatest charm of all was she would have a 
10904 grievance; not the worn-out grievance of some imaginary ailment that 
10905 nobody believes in but the “doctor,” not the mock agonies of a heart 
10906 complaint, that saves the sufferer from eating bad dinners in vulgar 
10907 company, but always allows them a respite for a dejeuner at the court, 
10908 or a supper after the Opera, with a few chosen convives, but a real, 
10910 pathetic. Such were the different feelings with which two persons 
10911 contemplated the same event. Sir Stafford's thoughts turned instantly 
10912 towards England. What would be said there by all those friends who had 
10914 compassion was even less endurable than the malice of others; and 
10916 sudden? In his heart Sir Stafford was glad that the doctor was absent; 
10917 much as he needed his counsel and advice, he still more dreaded the 
10918 terror of his triumphant eye at the accomplishment of his oft-repeated 
10921 From George he met no support whatever. He either believed, or thought 
10924  thing now and then, and yet not be cut by his acquaintance. And 
10925 the young Guardsman deemed his father's rigid notions nothing but 
10928 back-piece of chain-armor. George Onslow, therefore, halted between the 
10929 two opinions. Adhering to his father's side from feelings of affection 
10931 indeed, aware how formidable the difference had already become between 
10932 them, and that, before that very night closed in, they had mutually 
10933 agreed upon a separation, which while occupying the same house, was 
10939 happiness was very wide apart from her situation as the companion of a 
10941 unfair to her own family, as unjust to the girl herself, to detain her 
10942 then in such a conjuncture. And yet what was to be done? Apart from all 
10943 the unpleasantness of proposing an abrupt return to her home, came 
10944 the thought of the avowal that must accompany the suggestion, the very 
10945 confession he so dreaded to make. Of course the gossiping of servants 
10946 would soon circulate the rumor. But then they might not spread it beyond 
10947 the Alps, nor make it the current talk of a German watering-place. Thus 
10949 the struggle was not a long one. He sat down and wrote to Lady Hester. 
10950 Naturally assuming that all the reasons which had such force for himself 
10951 would weigh equally with her, he dwelt less upon the arguments for 
10952 Kate's departure than upon the mode in which it might be proposed and 
10953 carried out. He adverted with feeling to the sacrifice the loss would 
10954 inflict upon Lady Hester, but professed his conviction in the belief 
10961 she is already attracted. We have exposed her to all the seductions of 
10964 to be realized, and we must now consign her to a home where all the 
10965 affections of fond relatives will be unequal to the task of blinding her 
10968 about to write 'recompense;' nor would the word be unsuitable recompense 
10969 Mr. Dalton for the injury we have done him as regards his child; and if 
10973 The note concluded with some hints as to the manner of making the 
10974 communication to Kate, the whole awkwardness of which Sir Stafford, if 
10977 The whole temper of the letter was feeling and tender. Without even in 
10978 the most remote way adverting to what had occurred between Lady Hester 
10979 and himself, he spoke of their separation simply in its relation to Kate 
10980 Dalton, for whom they were both bound to think and act with caution. 
10981 As if concentrating every thought upon her, he did not suffer any other 
10982 consideration to interfere. Kate, and Kate only, was all its theme. 
10984 Lady Hester, however, read the lines in a very different spirit. She had 
10988 almost all vitality, suspended, under the influence of an exaggerated 
10989 credulity, when the letter was laid upon the table. 
10991 “What is that your maid has just left out of her hand?” asked the 
10999 The doctor gave a look of triumph at the bystanders, and went on: 
11001 “Has the letter come from a distant country, or from a correspondent 
11006 “Where is the writer at this moment?” asked he. 
11008 “In the house,” said she, with another and more violent shuddering. 
11010 “I now take the letter in my hand,” said the doctor, “and what am I 
11015 The doctor showed the letter on every side, with a proud and commanding 
11016 gesture. “There is a name written in the corner of the letter, beneath 
11017 the address. Do you know that name?” 
11019 A heavy, thick sob was the reply. 
11021 “There there be calm, be still,” said he, majestically motioning 
11023 and tranquil. “Are the contents of this letter such as will give you 
11026 A shake of the head was the answer. 
11028 “Are they painful?” 
11032 “Will these tidings be productive of grand consequences?” 
11036 “What will you do, when you read them?” 
11040 “In compliance with the spirit, or in rejection?” 
11044 “Sleep on, sleep on,” said the doctor, with a wave of his hand; and, as 
11048 deception and trick, whose philosophy teaches them to discredit all that 
11049 they cannot comprehend. I trust you may never be of this number.” 
11053 “Like all the secrets of nature, its phenomena are above belief; yet, to 
11054 those who study them with patience and industry, how compatible do they 
11055 seem with the whole order and spirit of creation. The great system of 
11057 the centrifugal being in reality the centripetal, and those impulses we 
11058 vainly fancy to be our own instincts being the impressions of external 
11067 “I!” said she, blushing with shame and surprise together; “surely you 
11068 mistake, sir. I am neither born to rank, nor like to attain it.” 
11070 “Both one and the other, young lady,” said he, solemnly; “high as 
11071 your position will one day be, it will not be above the claims of your 
11072 descent. It is not on fallible evidence that I read the future.” 
11085 black vista where the bright lightning of prophecy throws its momentary 
11090 “I know of them but by their accomplishment. I see you not in the 
11091 present or the past, but in the future. There your image is revealed to 
11093 barbaric in magnificence; there is something feudal in the state by 
11094 which you are encompassed that almost speaks of another age.” 
11099 shadows of many a dark tint moving along the sunlit surface.” 
11104 will hear no further questioning. Look to our patient here, and if 
11105 that letter agitate her over-much, let me be sent for.” And, with these 
11106 words, delivered oracularly, the doctor left the room, while Kate seated 
11107 herself beside the sofa where Lady Hester slept. 
11109 It was late in the night when Lady Hester awoke, and soon remembering 
11110 that a letter had arrived, broke the seal and read it. If the proposal 
11111 of Sir Stafford was in every way unacceptable, there was something which 
11112 compensated for all in the excitement of spirits an act of opposition 
11115 made the not uncommon error of mistaking sorrow for repentance, and 
11117 steps. It is difficult to say whether such an amende would have 
11121 and as, with her, a resolve and a mode of action were usually the work 
11122 of the same moment, she motioned to Kate to sit down beside her on the 
11128 Kate pressed the hand she held in her own to her lips with fervor, but 
11131 “I say this,” said Lady Hester, rapidly, “because the moment has come to 
11133 by what means have at last discovered, what I fancy the whole world has

11737 about her noble personages with the profusion of a child strewing 
11738 wild-flowers. There were Dukes she had known from their cradles; 
11741 advanced stage in her history, when all these distinguished individuals

11746 everything on the balls.” It is needless to state that, in such pleasant 
11747 converse, she had no memory for the noble Viscount's own transgressions.

11760 similar offences laid to my charge; and I trust to you and the Onslows

11847 to take his leave. He was perfectly satisfied with the results of his 
11848 visit. He had secretly enjoyed all the absurdities of his hostess, and 
11852 seen the Polish Count in a society which, even such as it was, was 
11853 many degrees above his pretensions; and although they met without 
11854 recognition, a masonic glance of intelligence had passed between them; 
11855 and, lastly, he had made an ally of the dear Zoe herself, ready to 
11856 swear to his good character, and vouch for the spotless honor of all his

11890 found the patient Purvis very red in the face, and with other signs of

12077 Hester's chief danglers, and the patron of the Turf in Tuscany, would 
12078 n't even allude to a horse before him. Prince Midchekoff went further, 
12081 spooney talk about racing, and dreaded the tiresome display of a 
12082 “Tartar feast,” these were all threatening indications, and he saw their 
12085 policy with success; but here it would have been inapplicable, and the 
12089 “In what a mess does the want of money involve a man!” thought he, as 
12090 he lay before the half-dying embers of the wood fire. “Had I won my bets 
12092 my position been to-day! That the simple change of one name for another 
12093 in my betting-book the mere hazard of a choice, of a horse, too should 
12094 influence a man's whole life, is a pretty fair instance of what the 
12095 world is! Had I 'come right,' I should now be the favored guest of some 
12097 flirting with his daughters. Fortune willed it otherwise, and here I 
12100 happen; and who can tell what another three weeks may bring forth? 
12101 perhaps, already, there is mischief brewing. What if my Lady's refusal 
12105 bold game, after all, for them to play! Reprisals to two of them, at 
12108 nothing but ill-fortune since the day I might have married Hester, and 
12109 yet hung back, and that very same year she marries another, and inherits 
12111 my lot through life; always backing the loser till the very moment when 
12114 As these thoughts passed through his mind, weariness, the silence of the 
12115 hour, the darkened room, induced slumber; and although once or twice he 
12116 made a half-effort to arouse himself and go home, the listless feeling 
12117 gained the mastery, and he dropped off to sleep. The uneasy consciences 
12118 have oftentimes very easy slumbers. Norwood's was of the calmest; not a 
12121 It was already nigh day as he lay thus, when the dull roll of wheels 
12122 beneath the window in part awoke him; at least, it so far aroused him 
12124 Onslow, on the return from his dinner-party. He lay for some minutes 
12125 expecting to hear his step upon the stair, and see him enter the room; 
12127 when he heard the sound of a hand upon the lock of the door. 
12129 It is one of the strange instincts of half-slumber to be often more 
12130 alive to the influence of subdued and stealthy sounds than to louder 
12131 noises. The slightest whisperings, the low murmurings of a human voice, 
12132 the creaking of a chair, the cautious drawing back of a curtain will jar 
12133 upon and arouse the faculties that have been insensible to the rushing 
12134 flow of a cataract or the dull booming of the sea. 
12136 Slight as were the sounds now heard, Norwood started as he listened to 
12137 them, and, at once arousing himself, he fixed his eyes upon the door, in 
12138 which the handle was seen to turn slowly and cautiously. The impression 
12144 The door at last opened; at first, a very little, and slowly, then 
12145 gradually more and more, till, by the mysterious half-light to which his 
12146 eyes had grown accustomed, Norwood could see the flounces of a female 
12147 dress, and the small, neat foot of a woman beneath it. The faint, 
12148 uncertain flame of the fire showed him thus much, but left the remainder 
12149 of the figure in deep shadow. 
12151 Whether from excess of caution, or that she was yet hesitating what 
12153 who had subdued his breathing to the utmost, lay in the deep shadow, 
12154 speculating on the upshot of an adventure from which he promised 
12156 the arched instep indicated a degree of rank in the wearer that gave a 
12157 piquancy to the incident, and imparted a zest to the curiosity of a 
12158 man who probably knew no higher pleasure in life than in possessing the 
12163 saw, or fancied that he saw, the door beginning slowly to close. Whether 
12165 gesture of impatience on his part threw down one of the cushions of the 
12166 sofa. A slight shriek so slight as to be barely heard broke from the 
12167 female, and she banged the door to. Norwood reached it with a spring; 
12168 but although, as he wrenched it open, he could yet hear the rustling of 
12169 a woman's dress in the passage, the sharp sound of a door hastily shut 
12173 “At least, the fair visitor belongs to the family; that much I may rely 
12174 upon,” said he, as he lighted a candle to explore the locality a little 
12176 was locked on the inside; but to what portion of the house it led he 
12177 could not even conjecture. He was not a very unlikely man to trace the 
12185 For a moment or two, however, he almost doubted whether the whole might 
12188 upon the floor, where a small fragment of a lace dress lay, as it was 
12189 caught and torn off in the closing door. Norwood took it up, and sat 
12196 accompanied each. “No matter,” thought he, “the secret will keep.” 
12198 He suddenly remembered, at the instant, that he had promised an 
12199 acquaintance to pass some days with him in the Maremma, shooting; and, 
12202 his pocketbook the little fragment of lace, a clew to a mystery he was 
12211 a soldier was neither very adventurous nor exciting, since otherwise 
12218 “I could have been so happy to have lived with them,” thought he, “even 
12221 our own affections, the happy fireside, that sufficed us for all 
12222 the blandishments of wealth and riches. Still there would have been 
12224 my blood as a Dalton. It was not thus my ancestors understood their 
12225 station, it was not with such lowly ambitions their hearts were stirred. 
12231 where, without the indignity of a patron, the path of honorable 
12234 me, he shall not have to blush for the Dalton blood,” said the boy, 
12235 enthusiastically; and he revelled in a dream of the old Count's ecstasy 
12236 on finding a nephew so worthy of their name, and in his fancy he saw 
12237 pictures of future scenes in which he figured. All of these had the 
12238 same rose tint; for while in some he imagined himself winning the 
12239 high rewards of great achievements, in others he was the caressed and 
12241 been thus!” cried he, laughing at the conceit, “trudging along 
12242 the high-road with a knapsack on my shoulder, like a Bursch in his 
12243 'Wander-jahre;'” and then he vowed to himself that “he would have a 
12245 up at some future day beside the decorated soldier he was yet to be.” 
12248 features almost noble, more often its traits are of the very meanest. 
12249 Frank's egotism was of the former kind. He wanted to attain distinction 
12250 by an honorable path, he would not have stooped to any other. He was 
12253 element of success, that patient discipline of the mind which, made 
12254 up of humility and confidence, can wait and bide its time, earning the 
12255 prizes of life before it claim them. His pride of family, however, was 
12258 involve even the bearer in disgrace. 
12261 note of the way as he went. Avoiding, from a sense of pride, to 
12262 associate with the “Travelling Youths,” as they are called, he walked 
12264 was mostly a dreary and uninteresting road, either leading through dark 
12266 the stubble of the tall maize, or the stunted vines, were the only 
12267 traces of vegetation. As he drew near the Tyrol, however, the great 
12268 mountains came in sight, while the continual ascent told that he was 
12269 gradually reaching the land of glaciers and snow-peaks. Day by day he 
12270 found the road less and less frequented: these lonely districts were 
12271 little resorted to by the wandering apprentices, so that frequently 
12274 those daydreams in which he loved to revel. Now and then some giant 
12275 mountain glittering in the sun, or some dark gorge thousands of feet 
12278 resumed their old track, and he would plod along, staff in hand, as 
12281 Walking from before daybreak to a late hour of the evening, Frank 
12282 frequently accomplished in his day's journey as many miles as the 
12283 traveller who, by post, only spent the few hours of mid-day on the road; 
12286 three post-horses, had regularly passed him on the road, and always 
12287 about the same hour. 
12290 the ascent of the Arlberg, he little knew that the carriage, about half 
12291 a mile in front, had been his travelling companion for the past week. 
12292 Disdaining to follow the winding high-road, Frank ascended by those 
12293 foot-tracks which gain upon the zig-zags, and thus soon was miles in 
12294 advance of the caleche. At last he reached the half-way point of ascent, 
12295 and was glad to rest himself for a few minutes on one of the benches 
12296 which German thoughtfulness for the wayfarer never neglects to place 
12297 in suitable spots. A low parapet of a couple of feet separated the road 
12298 from a deep and almost perpendicular precipice, at the foot of which, 
12299 above two thousand feet beneath, stood the village of Stuben. There was 
12300 the little chapel in which he had his morning's mass, there the 
12301 little Platz, where he had seen the post-horses getting ready for the 
12302 travellers; there, too, the little fountain, covered with a shed of 
12303 straw, and glistening with many an icicle in the bright sun. The very 
12304 voices of the people reached him where he sat; and the sounds of a 
12305 street-organ floated upwards through the still atmosphere. It was a 
12311 The sound of feet upon the snow suddenly roused him, and, on looking 
12312 round, Frank saw a traveller slowly coming up the pass. His dress at 
12314 merely sauntering along in advance of his carriage. In the mere cursory 
12320 “This is the fifth day we have been fellow-travellers; and although I 
12325 in arranging the straps of his knapsack. 
12327 “Are you a soldier?” asked the stranger. 
12335 “Ah! my own old corps,” said the other, gayly. “I served four years with 
12336 them in the Banat. From what part of the Empire are you you have n't the 
12345 insolent than the words. 
12347 “I am Count Ernest of Walstein,” said the other, without a touch of 
12352 “What rank do you hold in the service?” asked Frank, boldly. 
12359 “I was twenty-eight last August,” was the calm reply. 
12364 The other laughed, and after a brief pause, said, “People are in the 
12366 be the rule.” 
12368 “Be it so: even as an exception, the example is a bright one. Another 
12371 “If you mean that I have earned my rank by services, boy,” said the 
12373 another source.” 
12375 Frank looked as though he were curious to hear the explanation, but the 
12376 other gave none. 
12380 “Dalton,” replied the boy, more respectfully than before. 
12382 “We have a field-marshal of that name in the service, a most gallant old 
12387 “Indeed! So you are a grand-nephew to the Graf von Auersberg,” said the 
12396 “This, then, may be mine, sir,” said Frank, throwing his knapsack on his 
12399 “Is not the Franz Carl at Vienna?” said the Count, not seeming to notice 
12400 the irritation of his manner. 
12404 “Well, then, as I am going thither, perhaps you will accept of a seat in 
12407 There was a frankness in the way this offer was made that suddenly 
12408 routed the ill-temper Frank had fallen into. No one was less disposed 
12409 than himself to accept of a favor from a perfect stranger; but the tone 
12410 and manner of the proffer had, somehow, disarmed it of all appearance of 
12411 such; and as he stood uncertain what answer to make, the Count added: 
12419 another day or two,” said the Count, familiarly; “so step in, and no 
12422 The caleche had drawn up as he spoke, and the courier stood, cap in 
12423 hand, beside the door, so that Frank had no time for any but an abrupt 
12424 refusal, and that he could not give; he therefore bowed his head, and 
12425 sprang in. The door was slammed sharply to, and the next moment the 
12426 horses were rattling along over the snow, the merry bells of the harness 
12427 jingling pleasantly as they went. 
12429 Probably no two beings could present a much stronger contrast than the 
12432 pleasure-sick, weary, and discontented; the other, poor, and almost 
12433 friendless, full of hope, and ardent with all the buoyancy of youth. The 
12434 Count was as jaded and tired of life as the cadet was eager to enjoy it. 
12435 Notwithstanding perhaps we should rather say in virtue of these strong 
12436 contrarieties, they made admirable travelling companions, and the road 
12439 At Innspruck they halted for a day or two, and Frank accompanied his new 
12440 friend to the cafes and theatres, mingling in the throng of those whose 
12442 dress and demeanor with these, Frank was obliged to spend the golden 
12444 or another, sacrifices that cost him many a pang, but which, from pride, 
12446 everywhere as the nephew of the old field-marshal Von Auersberg; and as 
12447 nothing was more common than to see a young cadet dispensing the 
12449 surprised that the youth should indulge in these habits and tastes of 
12451 habituated to these modes of life, for whether he played or drank, or in 
12452 whatever excesses he mingled, there was ever the same joyous spirit; and 
12453 Frank Dalton had all the outward signs of a youth rich in every accident 
12457 debased before himself; but, by degrees, the levity of action induced, 
12458 as it ever will do, the levity of thinking; and he suffered himself to 
12459 believe that “he was no worse than others.” A more fatal philosophy than 
12462 and his vanity made him credulous; he therefore implicitly believed 
12463 all that his new companions told him, the familiar “thee and thou” of 
12464 camaraderie giving an air of friendship to all the flatteries. 
12466 “Were I a nephew of a field-marshal like thee, I'd not serve in an 
12467 infantry corps. I 'd be in the Lichtenstein Hussars or the Lancers of 
12468 the Kaiser,” said one. 
12470 “So he will,” cried another. “Dalton only joined the Franz Carl to get 
12474 “Old Auersberg can make thee what he will, lad,” said a third. “He might 
12476 loved him as a brother.” 
12479 commanded for many years on the Turkish frontier, in those good days 
12480 when our Grenzers used to make forays upon the villages, and every 
12484 thus secured to thee.” 
12487 have no uncles in the 'Maria Teresa' category.” 
12494 this smoking his meerschaum in a corner. “Has the empire lost its 
12495 aristocratic character? Are not birth and blood to have their claims, as 
12498 This speech met a ready acceptance, for the company consisted of those 
12499 who either were, or affected to be, of noble extraction. 
12501 “How our fathers deceive themselves in trying to deceive us!” said a 
12504 twenty miles in my life save on the saddle. They fitted me with my 
12506 jingled in my purse as in his. They gave me their blessing and a map of 
12507 the road, with each day's journey marked out upon it. And how far did 
12511 country house or other Honyadi's Ctzyscheny's Palfi's; all lay on the 
12513 made a capital acquaintance, too, the Prince Paul of Ettlingen, who, 
12515 I joined them at Leutmeritz, I was already an officer. What stuff it 
12516 is they preach about economy and thrift! Are we the sons of peasants 
12517 or petty shopkeepers? It comes well, too, from them in their princely 
12522 to help it down! Our worthy progenitors knew better in their own young 
12526 “I suppose the world is pretty much alike, in every age,” said the 
12527 Count, laughing. “It now and then takes a virtuous fit, and affects 
12528 to be better than it used to be; but I shrewdly suspect that the only 
12529 difference is in the hypocritical pretension. When I entered the service 
12530 and it is not so many years ago that I cannot recollect it the cant was, 
12531 to resemble that rough school of the days of old Frederick and Maria 
12532 Teresa. Trenck's 'Pandours,' with their scarlet breeches stuffed into 
12533 their wide boot-tops, were the mode; and to wear your moustache to your 
12535 the veritable types of the soldier. Now we have changed all that. 
12536 We have the Anglomania of English grooms and equipages, top-boots, 
12537 curricles, hurdle-races, champagne suppers. Dalton will be the ton in 
12541 The youth blushed deeply; partly in conscious pride at the flattery, 
12542 partly in the heartfelt shame at its inappropriateness to himself; and 
12543 even the sincerity with which his comrades drank his health, could not 
12544 drown the self-reproaches he was suffering under. 
12546 “Thou art an only son, too, Dalton!” said another. “What favors fortune 
12548 my father is a count of the empire, four of us have to take service in 
12549 the infantry.” 
12552 and sharp under-jaw bespoke a Pole. “I am a second lieutenant in the 
12553 regiment that my grandfather raised and equipped at his own cost; and 
12555 broke, like the meanest 'bursch' in the corps.” 
12559 “And with a field-marshal for a grand-uncle!” chimed in another. 
12565 nothing but a war to make it the best life going.” 
12567 “A war with whom?” cried several together. 
12570 our old scores about Frauconia; with Russia, if you like better, for the 
12573 frontier, and push our limits to the Apennines; I'd say with England, 
12579 “Easily enough, through our ambassador at the Porte, or some outlying 
12582 “Hang your politics!” broke in a Hungarian. “Let us fight when the time 
12583 comes, but not bother our heads about the cause. I 'd rather take 
12588 “Thou shalt give us a jolly supper at the 'Schwan,' Dalton, when we meet 
12589 at Vienna,” said another. 
12591 “And we'll pledge those fair sisters of thine and they 're both 
12592 handsome, I 'll be sworn in the best Tokay Palfi's vineyard can yield.” 
12594 “My regiment will be in garrison, in the Leopoldstadt, next month, and 
12595 I'll remind thee of this pledge.” 
12597 “And we shall be at Lintz,” broke in another; “and thou mayst reckon on 
12602 “Ay, let us name the day,” cried several together. 
12607 “Nay, nay the day month after he arrives at Vienna,” cried the Bohemian. 
12608 “I have given three breakfasts and five suppers on the occasion of my 
12609 promotion, and the promotion has never come yet.” 
12611 “The day month after I arrive, then, be it,” said Dalton. “We meet at 
12614 “The 'Schwan,' lad, the first restaurant of Europe. Let men talk as they 
12615 will of the Cadran Bleu and the Trois Freres, I'd back Hetziuger's cook 
12616 against the world; and as for wine, he has Steinkammer at thirty florins 
12617 the flask! And we'll drink it, too, eh, Dalton? and we'll give a 'Hoch 
12618 Lebe' to that old grandfather or grand-uncle of thine. We'll add ten 
12621 “A poor service to Dalton,” said another; “but here comes Walstein's 
12622 horses, and now for the last glass together before we part.” 
12626 progress as the bottle went round. The third call of the postilion's 
12628 to resist at last cut short the festivities, and Frank once more found 
12629 himself in the caleche, where at least a dozen hands contested for the 
12630 last shake of his, and a shower of good wishes mingled with the sounds 
12631 of the crashing wheels. 
12634 comrades are like brothers.” 
12636 Walstein smiled at the boy's enthusiasm, and lighted his meerschaum in 
12637 silence; and thus they journeyed, each too full of his own thoughts to 
12639 way to dark or serious reflections; the blandishments and caresses of 
12642 to himself his father's pride at seeing him in the society of these 
12643 high-born youths; of Kate's delight at the degree of notice he 
12648 “What would Hanserl say, too,” thought he, “if he saw me seated at the 
12649 table with those whose high-sounding names are the pride of Austrian 
12650 chivalry, the Thuns, the Lichtensteins, the Schwartenschilds, and the 
12651 Walsteins, families old as the Hapsburgs themselves? Little Hanserl, to 
12652 whom these glorious families were the great lights of history, oh, if he 
12654 neck, they called me comrade!” From this he wandered on to thoughts 
12655 of his uncle, investing the old field-marshal with every noble and 
12658 father and his sisters; how often had he to repeat their names and 
12659 paint their resemblances, going over the most minute details of family 
12660 history, and recounting the simplest incidents of their daily life, for 
12667 by the hoarse voice of a mounted dragoon, ordering the postilion to 
12668 halt; and, on looking out, he saw that they were drawn up close beside 
12669 the angle of the great wooden bridge that crosses the Danube, under the 
12671 him. At his feet, as it were, rolled the stream of the rapid Danube; its 
12672 impetuous flood splashing and foaming amid the fragments of ice floated 
12673 down from the mountain regions, and which every moment were shivered 
12674 against the stone breakwaters with the crash of thunder. Beyond the 
12675 river rose the fortified walls of the city, covered with a dense 
12677 which, with all the pomp of war, poured forth beneath the dark archway 
12678 of the entrance-gate, and, winding over the “glacis,” crossed the 
12679 bridge, and held on its course towards the Prater. 
12681 It was a clear, bright day of winter; the blue sky almost cloudless, and 
12682 the sharp outline of every object stood out, crisp and well defined, in 
12683 the thin atmosphere. Nothing could be more favorable for the effect of 
12685 the gay trappings and brilliant uniforms showed in all their splendor, 
12686 the scarlet Lancers, the blue-clad Hussars, the Cuirassiers, with their 
12687 towering helmets, vied with each other in soldierlike bearing; while the 
12690 detail; for, even to the “ambulances” for the wounded, everything was 
12691 there. 
12693 “A review by the Emperor!” said Walstein; “and see, there comes his 
12695 floating dolmans were seen at a little distance off in the plain. 
12697 “Oh, let us follow them!” cried Frank, enthusiastically. “Such a 
12700 “You 'll see enough, perhaps too many such,” said the Count, languidly. 
12702 in the very depth of winter, and spend a day in the snow of the Prater.” 
12704 “Who could have a thought for weather or hardship when engaged in such a 
12708 division, who, well mounted, and swathed in furs, canter down to the 
12709 ground, an hour after we have reached it, and ride back again when they 
12710 have 'taken the salute,' leaving us to plod wearily home, through wet 
12711 roads and sloppy streets, to our cold barracks. But just the reverse 
12712 is the opinion of those poor fellows yonder, with blue faces and 
12713 frostbitten knuckles, and who have neither pride in this display, nor 
12714 sympathy with the success of what is called 'a fine manoeuvre.'” 
12716 Frank shook his head distrustfully. He wished not to credit the opinion, 
12719 “That is the 'Franz Carl,' Dalton,” said Walstein, pointing to a column 
12720 of infantry, who, in their dark gray overcoats, seemed a sad-looking, 
12721 gloomy mass. “They've got the best band and the most savage colonel in 
12722 the service.” 
12724 Frank gazed at the regiment with a strange sensation of awe and fear. 
12729 meet with amongst them!” 
12735 “Brave enough,” said the other, laughing; “and as for distinction, an 
12737 is a poor one; the officers are from Upper Austria, with little or 
12739 kreutzers, waltz at the wine-gardens, and fight duels with sabres.” 
12741 Frank laughed at the description; but his laugh had more of gloom 
12742 than mirth about it, for he felt at every moment the false position 
12744 becoming. Every allusion to others showed him in what light he was 
12746 continue it?” were the questions that would obtrude upon him, and for 
12749 “There 's the corps for you, Dalton,” said Walstein, drawing his 
12750 attention to the “Hungarian Guard,” all glittering with gold embroidery, 
12751 and mounted upon the most beautiful white chargers, at once the most 
12752 perfect riders and the best mounted cavalry in Europe. “In that regiment 
12753 you are certain of being quartered either here or in Prague. Those laced 
12754 jackets are too costly wear to send down to the Banat, or among the 
12755 wilds of Wallachia. Besides, the Empress likes to see these gaudy 
12756 fellows on their 'schimmels' beneath the Palace windows. Your uncle 
12757 will, of course, grumble a little about the cost. Perhaps your father, 
12759 a 'dolman,' and four for a 'schabrach;' while ten or twelve horses the 
12761 Still, depend upon it, the corps is as good for service as it is costly, 
12762 and Creptowitz, their Colonel, is a true hussar.” 
12764 For a moment Dalton hesitated whether he should not make the honest 
12766 habits of cost and expense; but shame was too powerful to permit the 
12768 that any candor now would be the confession of a cheat. If these were 
12770 glimmered through the gloom; and this was, what he might expect from his 
12771 uncle. “If he be really rich, as they say,” thought Frank, “if his favor 
12772 be so great with the Emperor, even such a career as this may not be 
12773 above my prospects.” As he revolved these thoughts, he sat with his head 
12776 “You 're losing everything, Dalton,” said Walstein. “See, there go 
12777 the 'Kaiser Jagers,' with their bugles, the finest in the service; and 
12778 yonder are the Lichtenstein 'Light Horse,' mounted on thorough-bred 
12779 cattle; and there, to the left, those savage-looking fellows with long 
12780 beards, they are the 'Croat Grenadiers.' But here comes the Emperor!” 
12781  And, as he spoke, one deafening cheer burst forth along the line, and 
12782 was echoed back from the walls of Vienna; while every band struck up 
12783 the national hymn of Austria, and the proud notes of “God preserve the 
12784 Emperor!” floated through the air. 
12786 A brilliant staff of generals of every arm of the service accompanied 
12787 “the Kaiser;” and Walstein ran quickly over the names of these, many of 
12788 whom were among the first nobility of the Empire. Some were the war-worn 
12789 veterans of the great campaigns; some the young hopes of Austrian 
12791 well as the singularity of his uniform, attracted Frank's notice. He was 
12793 gold, and actually covered with the crosses and decorations of various 
12798 almost a compromise between the present and some bygone age. 
12800 The figure of the wearer, too, suited well this impression. There was 
12802 which relaxed into the polished urbanity of an old courtier as often as 
12803 the Emperor addressed him. When bowing to the mane of his charger, he 
12804 seemed the very type of courtesy; while, as he retired his horse, there 
12805 was all the address and ease of a practised rider. 
12807 “There, to the left of Walmoden, on the powerful black horse, do you see 
12808 that handsome old man in the purple tunic?” said Waldstein. 
12813 “Yes. It was the dress of the Artillery of the Imperial Guard in the 
12815 leave of the Emperor, a favor he only avails himself of on occasions 
12816 like the present.” 
12820 “He has all that the Empire can bestow, from the 'Iron Cross' to the 
12821 'Maria Teresa.' He has the 'Legion of Honor,' too, sent him by Napoleon 
12822 himself! It was that officer who at Elchingen rode up to the head of a 
12823 French column, and told them that the wagons they were pursuing were the 
12824 'ammunition of the rear-guard!' 'If you advance,' said he, 'we 'll fire 
12825 them, and blow you and ourselves to atoms!' The coolness and heroism of 
12826 the daring were well acknowledged by a brave enemy. The French halted, 
12827 and our train proceeded on its way. Mayhap you have heard the anecdote 
12830 “Never,” said Frank, still gazing with admiration at the old soldier. 
12832 “Then I may as well tell you that he is the Count Dalton von Auersberg,” 
12833  said Walstein, lying back to enjoy the youth's amazement. 
12840 But Frank never heard or heeded the remark; his whole soul was wrapped 
12841 up in the contemplation of the old field marshal, on whom he gazed as a 
12844 “He 's like my father,” muttered Frank, half aloud; “but 
12848 “Not here, though, not here!” said Walstein, laying his hand on the 
12849 youth's arm; for he almost feared lest he should give way to the sudden 
12850 impulse. “Were you even the Colonel of your regiment, you could not 
12854 slightingly the ties of blood and kindred; while Walstein, by no means 
12855 easy on the score of his companion's prudence, gave the word to the 
12856 postilion to drive on; and they entered the city of Vienna. 
12864 extravagant throughout Florence, and in proportion as the society which 
12865 frequented it was select and few in number, the more absurd were the 
12867 of a real, good, tangible scandal the world invented a thousand shadowy 
12869 as certain to kill character in the long run. 
12872 pronounced the lingering agonies of a broken heart. “My Lady's” late 
12874 a reckless gambler, who had already jeopardized all the wealth of 
12875 his family; and, as for Kate, she was at the mercy of that amiable 
12876 temperament of the human mind which always believes the worst, and as 
12877 constantly draws the darkest inference from its belief. 
12881 himself, should have had no concern for the world. My Lady did dine at 
12882 eleven o'clock at night, and the company was assuredly not that from 
12884 minor canons, consisting for the most part of that class of which we 
12885 have already made mention in a former chapter, with now and then some 
12889 ascribed to him. While Kate poor Kate was neither better nor worse than 
12890 the reader has hitherto known her. 
12892 We do not in this admission seek to conceal the fact that she was very 
12897 pleasing, that often wither and die in the cold chill of neglect. The 
12901 buoyancy of temperament, the last the very last remnant of her former 
12904 She was the belle of Florence. Her sovereignty admitted of nothing like 
12905 a rival. Whether she drove, or rode, or danced, or walked, the same 
12906 admiring throng surrounded her; some sincere in all their admiration, 
12907 others but following the lead which fashion took, and others, again, 
12908 watchful observers of a manner in which they fancied they could trace 
12909 the settled plan of a daring and ambitious character. Vanity had been 
12910 the foible of her childish years; it was now the vice of her womanhood. 
12913 pleasure in all the admiration she met with. 
12915 As an actor is said to “create the part” which is written for him, when 
12916 he impresses the personation with traits peculiarly his own, so did 
12918 fascinations; and probably the proudest days of her own triumphs never 
12919 yielded more enjoyment than she now felt in the flattering praises 
12923 had another source, and that, as a somewhat passee beauty, she knew the 
12927 less weight than other reasons. Lady Hester's own claims, besides, were 
12928 higher than these detractors admitted. She was, although not very young, 
12930 manner the perfection of that school to which she belonged. If her 
12931 affection for Kate was only another form of selfishness, it was not the 
12932 less strong on that account. She was the confidante of her sorrows, by 
12933 no means a sinecure office; the chief counsellor in all her plans; 
12934 she was the lay-figure on which she experimented a hundred devices 
12937 pride of family, the Dalton heritage, was too powerful in her to admit 
12943 The homage amid which she passed her life, the unceasing flow of 
12946 the royal house. The great Midchekoff gave balls in her honor. The Arab 
12953 away by the excitement of this adulation, yet, in her heart, she was 
12954 as little corrupted as was well possible. She could not be other 
12956 she disconnect the enjoyments around her from the possession of great 
12957 wealth. She thought of what she had been a few months back: the “same 
12958 Kate Dalton,” braving the snows of a dark German winter, with threadbare 
12962 of splendor had stopped here. It went further, however, and inspired a 
12965 Over and over again did she hear disparaging remarks bestowed upon the 
12968 whatever it did was certain to be absurd; and yet all of these people, 
12969 so laughed at and scorned, were in the enjoyment of means far above her 
12970 own father's! 
12973 sustain it! She invoked all her sophistry to assure herself that their 
12975 a remote one they should have “their own again;” and that as in family 
12976 and descent they were the equals of any, so they were not inferior in 
12977 all the just claims to consideration and respect. She tried to think of 
12978 her father and Nelly moving in the circles she now lived in; but, even 
12979 alone, and in the secrecy of her own thoughts, her cheek became scarlet 
12980 with shame, and she actually shuddered at the very notion. And even 
12982 how would he pass muster beside these essenced “fashionables” who now 
12984 father would have despised the lounging, unmanly lives they led, that 
12991 She became first aware of the great change in herself on recognizing 
12994 the door, in an ecstasy of delight to be alone with dearest Nelly, to 
12999 would bring up home before her, the snug little chamber of an evening, 
13000 as the bright fire glowed on the hearth, and Nelly brought out her tools 
13002 a description that Nelly wanted; and then the little discussions that 
13003 would ensue as to the shape of some weapon, or the fashion of some 
13004 costume of a past age, so often broken in upon by her father, whose 
13005 drolleries would set them laughing! 
13008 their daily life; the progress Nelly was making in her last group; its 
13009 difficulties how would she ponder over, and wonder how to meet them! 
13010 With what eager curiosity would she read the commonest details of the 
13011 household, the dreary burden of a winter's tale! and how her heart 
13012 bounded to hear of Frank the soldier although all the tidings were that 
13013 he was with his regiment, but “spoke little of himself or the service.” 
13015 Now, however, the glow of delight which a letter used to bring up was 
13017 wherefore or how; of shame, because Nelly's writing on the address was 
13018 quaint and old-fashioned; while the paper and the seal bespoke the very 
13021 eagerness, but in terror lest others should see and mark its vulgar 
13024 How differently, too, did the contents affect her! So long as they 
13028 was all grateful; even her gentle warnings against the seductions of 
13029 such a career were not unpleasing; but the subject changed to home, and 
13030 what an alteration came over her spirit! How dark and dismal became the 
13032 every detail, how insignificant the occupations that interested them! 
13034 How great the surprise she felt at their interest in such trifles; how 
13035 astonished that their hopes and fears, their wishes or their dreads, 
13041 further and say friends, for the terms in which he spoke of you evinced 
13043 come and tell us about you; indeed, he remained a day here for no other 
13050 had lately left Florence, trembling to think it might be the gorgeous 
13051 Russian, Naradskoi, the princely Neapolitan, Carnporese, or the haughty 
13052 Spaniard, Don Hernandez Orloes, who had visited their humble interior. 
13053 What a humiliation for her, if she were ever to see them again! Home, 
13054 at that instant, presented itself before her but as the witness of her 
13056 vulgarity associated! Her poor old father, around whose neck but a 
13060 blushed to fancy her humble guise and poor exterior; the little dress of 
13061 colored wool, from the pockets of which her carving-tools appeared; and 
13062 then how the scene rose before her! her father producing Nelly's last 
13064 pride, her sister's bashfulness, the stranger's pretended admiration! 
13065 Till now, these emotions had never seen a counterfeit. Oh, how she 
13066 shuddered as her thoughts took more and more the colors of reality, and 
13067 the room itself, and its poverty-struck furniture, rose before her! At 
13071 other errand but to speak of you, we should have been half overwhelmed 
13072 with the condescension; but in very truth, Kate, I quite forgot all

13087 What form her doubts might have taken there is no knowing, when Mr. 
13088 Albert Jekyl was seen to cross the courtyard, and enter the house. 
13090 Knowing that if any could, he would be the person to resolve the

13133 inquisitive sort of creature, who, if he only had the sense of hearing,

13137 of the head. “He made their acquaintance by affecting to know me. I 'm

13156 What could this possibly mean? It was but that very same day the post 
13157 brought her a letter from Nelly. Why had not her father said what he 
13161 The sight of the servant still in waiting for the answer recalled her 
13162 from these cross-questionings, and she hurried away to consult Lady 
13163 Hester about the reply. 
13165 “It's very shocking, my dear child,” said she, as she listened to the 
13166 explanation. “The Ricketts, they tell me, is something too dreadful; and 
13167 we have escaped her hitherto. You could n't be ill, could you?” 
13169 “But the letter?” said Kate, half smiling, half provoked. 
13171 “Oh, to be sure the letter! But Buccellini, you know, might take the 
13177 tears about it, the other day. He told me that you actually refused to 
13178 believe in the Madonna della Torre, although he showed you the phial 
13179 with the tears in it!” 
13181 “I only said that I had not seen the Virgin shed them,” said Kate. 
13183 “True, child! but you saw the tears; and you heard D'Esmonde remark, 
13184 that when you saw the garden of a morning, all soaked with wet, the

13191 “Now, Protestant that I am,” said Lady Hester, with the triumphant tone 
13192 of one who rose above all the slavery of prejudice, “Protestant that I 
13193 am, I believe in the 'Torre.' The real distinction to make is, between 
13198 bringing back the original theme.

13201 you must receive her, Kate; there 's no help for it! Say three o'clock,

13221 crimson, instead of cherry-color, although I told Jekyl twice over they 
13222 ought to be the very tint of Lady Melgund's nose! There, now; goodbye.

13272 “You must speak louder; there 's a kind of damper on the voice in this 
13275 “Where 's the pain?” screamed Dalton. 
13277 “There there no need to roar,” whispered the other. “The pain is here 
13278 over the stomach, round the ribs, the back everywhere.” 
13280 “Ah, I know it well,” said Dalton, with a wry contortion of the face.

13307 an ear-trumpet, a mark of the most unbounded good faith on his part, and 
13311 “I've been many years at Constantinople,” said he, adjusting the 
13312 instrument, “and the confounded muezzin has made me a little deaf. It's 
13313 an everlasting calling to prayers, day and night, there.” 
13315 “How they ever expect to get to heaven by tormentin', and teasin', is

13332 “Of course, punch also. A pipe, a cup of coffee, the bath, and a little

13347 and tiresome people would undermine the best constitution in the world.

13517 hour, the length of the story, the parenthetical interruptions, which, 
13518 although only bypaths, often looked exactly like the high-road,

13660 interest, and the devil knows what besides of law expenses--” 
13662 Here he stopped abruptly, for he had unwittingly strayed into another

13714      Frank 's well sick of soldiering; they chained him up like 
13715      a dog, with his hand to his leg, the other night for going 
13716      to the play; and if he was n't a born gentleman, he says, 
13717      they 'd have given him “four-and-twenty,” as he calls it,

13727      Prussian dollar. 'T is a nice way for one of the Daltons to

13735      how is the old man, and is the gout bad with him still? I

13796 why, he was not quite satisfied with the performance.

13802 presented to her; but that this coming winter the Embassy will, in all 
13808 any other channel.” 
13814 “Depend upon 't, Fogles, my daughter is in the best society of the

13821 further than a long and intricate dissertation on the Dalton blood for 
13823 the respected individuals there recorded, and was only awoke at last 
13824 by Dalton rising to take leave, an event at last suggested by the empty 
13832 them. Good-night, good-night! I 'll take care of your letter. It shall 
13833 go to-morrow in the Embassy bag.” 
13840 To afford the reader the explanation contained in the preceding chapter, 
13842 and suspense, for the hour of Mrs. Ricketts's visit. Although her mind 
13843 principally dwelt upon the letter which had been announced as coming 
13844 from her father, an event so strange as naturally to cause astonishment, 
13845 she also occasionally recurred to the awkwardness of receiving persons 
13848 before, and the incident would have worn a very different aspect to 
13849 her eyes. She would have dwelt alone on the kindness of one, an utter 
13851 the attention of a visit. She would have been grateful for the 
13853 viewed the whole as a sort of flattering notice, and never dreamed of 
13855 associated with the event as it at present stood. She was greatly 
13856 changed in many respects. She had been daily accustomed to hear the 
13858 slightly censured. For every fault and failing there was a skilful 
13859 excuse or a charitable explanation. The errors of the fashionable world 
13860 were shown to be few, insignificant, and venial; and the code showed no 
13861 exception to the rule that “well-bred people can do no wrong.” Vulgarity 
13862 alone was criminal; and the sins of the underbred admitted of no 
13864 judgments, had reason been ever appealed to; but such was not the 
13865 case. Ridicule alone was the arbiter; whatever could be scoffed at was 
13870 the few depreciatory remarks of Lady Hester concerning her, would have 
13872 It was, then, in no pleasant flurry of spirits, that, just as the clock 
13873 struck three, Kate heard the heavy door of the palace flung wide, and 
13874 the sound of wheels echo beneath the vaulted entrance. The next moment 
13876 livery, passed into the courtyard, having deposited its company in the 
13879 There had been a time, and that not so very far back either, when the 
13881 beat to the full as strong, albeit with very different emotions. Now, 
13882 however, she actually glanced at the windows to see if it had attracted 
13883 notice, with a kind of terror at the ridicule it would excite. Never did 
13885 intolerable a noise before! Why would people dress up their servants 
13886 like harlequins? What was the meaning of that leopard-skin rug for the 
13887 feet? It was an odious little vehicle, altogether. There was a tawdry, 
13892 groom of the chambers; and although his features were immaculate in 
13893 their expressions of respect, Kate felt offended at what she thought was 
13894 a flippancy in the man's manner. 
13896 Although the announcement was thus made, the high and mighty personages 
13897 were still three rooms off, and visible only in the dim distance, coming 
13902 pyramid of crimson velvet and ermine to be, from the summit of which 
13905 and completely shut out the slender proportions of Mr. Scroope Purvis, 
13906 who, from being loaded like a sumpter-mule with various articles for the 
13907 road, was passed over by the groom of the chambers, and believed to be a 
13908 servant. Slow as was the order of march, Purvis made it still slower by 
13909 momentarily dropping some of the articles with which he was charged; 
13910 and as they comprised a footstool, a poodle, two parasols, an album, 
13912 portable tire-screen, his difficulties may be rather compassionated than 
13916 smash my lorgnette he'll smother Fidele. How very awkward how absurd we 
13917 shall look!” Such were the sotto voce accompaniments that filled up the 
13918 intervals till they arrived at the great drawing-room, where Kate Dalton 
13921 If the reader has ever watched a great tragedy queen emerging from 
13922 the flats, when, after a lively dialogue with the prompter, and the 
13923 utterance of a pleasant jest, she issues forth upon the open stage, to 
13924 vent the sorrows or the wrongs of injured womanhood, he may form some 
13925 faint idea of the rapid transformation that Mrs. Ricketts underwent 
13926 as she passed the door-sill. Her first movement was a sudden bound 
13928 imposing could accomplish, and then, throwing her arms wide, she seemed 
13930 had she done, if Kate had responded to the sign. A deep and very formal 
13940 present my sister, Miss Ricketts. My brother, Mr. Scroope Purvis, Miss 
13944 seated, a very tedious operation, in which the arrangement of cushions, 
13952 “A poor invalid as I am, rarely rising from a sofa except to snatch the 
13953 perfumed odors of a violet in spring, or to listen to the murmurs of a 
13954 rippling fountain; denied all the excitements of society by a nervous 
13955 temperament so finely strung as to be jarred by contact, even the 
13965 eyes from Kate to the gorgeous chamber in which they were seated. “May I 
13966 ask if the taste of these decorations be yours, Miss Dalton?” 
13970 “I declare, I like these hangings better than 'Gobelins' they are 
13971 lighter and more graceful. You remember, Martha, I told the dear Queen 
13973 discussed the point every morning at breakfast for a week, and the poor 
13974 dear King at last called us the 'blue devils; 'very happy, wasn't it, 
13978 his poodle under his arm, was making a tour of the room, peering into 
13982 “I 'm tired of Wou-Wou-Wou--” Here the poodle barked, doubtless in 
13983 the belief that he was responding to an invitation. “Down, Fidele! 
13984 Wou-ver-mans,” gulped out Purvis. “He 's always the same.” 
13986 “But those dear white palfreys, how I love them! I always have a white

13991 “And there is something so touching so exquisitely touching in 
13992 those Flemish interiors, where the goodwife is seated reading, and a 
13993 straggling sunbeam comes slanting in upon the tiled floor. Little peeps

14018 ourselves. All the distinguished Irish are of the Reformed faith.” 
14020 “I am a Catholic, madam,” said Kate, not knowing whether to be more 
14021 amused than annoyed at the turn the conversation had taken. 
14023 “I knew it,” cried Purvis, in delight. “I tracked your carriage to the 
14024 D-D-Duomo, and I went in after you, and saw you at the co-co-co-co--”

14045 “Give her the posers,” whispered Purvis, louder. 
14047 “Be quiet, Scroope. I have been fortunate enough to resolve the doubts 
14048 of more than one ere this. That dear angel, the Princess Ethelinda of 
14050 sweet evenings together.”

14062 bearing the title, “Three Posers for Papists, by M. R.”

14070 and yourself have vouchsafed me will only be more lasting by leaving the 
14071 impression of them unassociated with anything unpleasing. You were good

14076 triumphs. Martha, where is the letter?” 
14082 “Yes, Scroope, I gave it to you, at the drawing-room fire--” 
14084 “Yes, to be sure, and I put it into the ca-ca-ca--” 
14086 “Not the candle, I hope,” cried Kate, in terror. 
14088 “No, into the card-rack; and there it is now.” 
14095 “Of course not, my dear Miss Dalton; but shall I commit the precious

14104 upon the colloquy; for it was Fidele had thrown down a Sevres jar, and 
14105 lay, half-buried and howling, under the ruins. There was, of course, a 
14106 general rising of the company, some to rescue the struggling poodle, and 
14107 others in vain solicitude to gather up the broken fragments of the once 
14110 sick with shame and sorrow, at the sight, not heeding one syllable 
14111 of the excuses and apologies poured in upon her, nor of the equally 
14114 the pieces carefully, the most difficult connoisseur would not be able

14124 well-cushioned sofa from the calamity. 
14126 Martha now flew to the bell-rope and pulled it violently, while Purvis 
14127 threw open the window, and with such rash haste as to upset a stand of 
14128 camellias, thereby scattering plants, buds, earth, and crockery over the 
14129 floor, while poor Kate, thunderstruck at the avalanche of ruin around 
14130 her, leaned against the wall for support, unable to stir or even speak. 
14131 As Martha continued to tug away at the bell, the alarm, suggesting the 
14132 idea of fire, brought three or four servants to the door together. 
14138 “Bring wine,” said Kate, faintly, to the astonished butler, who, not 
14143 “She don't dislike Mar-Mar-Marco-brunner,” whispered Purvis to the 
14146 Had the irruption been one of veritable housebreakers, had the occasion

14165 injunctions to struggle for a mastery of expression, the symptoms could

14168 devil's tattoo, kept up by her heels upon the floor, and her knuckles 
14169 occasionally on the table, and now and then on Scroope's head, added 
14170 fearfully to the effect of her screams, which varied from the deep groan 
14171 of the melodrame to the wildest shrieks of tragedy. 
14178 the most anxious friend might have been comforted on the present

14188 the sword. Won't you have a glass of wine, Miss Dalton?” 
14195 “What is to be done, then?” said Kate, in terror. 
14197 “She must be put to bed at once, the room darkened, and the strictest 
14200 “Oh, of course, anything everything at such a moment,” cried the 
14206 step down to the carriage, and bring up--” Here Miss Ricketts's voice 
14207 degenerated into an inaudible whisper; but Scroope left the room to obey 
14208 the command. 
14211 the train of unpleasant consequences that were to follow this unhappy 
14213 Hester cross her mind, till, suddenly, the whole flashed upon her, by 
14214 the appearance of her maid Nina in the drawing-room. 
14224 “I'd be a butterfly!” warbled the sick lady, in a low weak treble; while 
14227 “Hush! be still!” said Martha, motioning the surrounders to silence. 
14231 A significant shrug of the shoulders, more negative than affirmative, 
14232 was the only answer. 
14234 “I'd be a gossamer, and you'd be the King of Thebes,” said Mrs. 
14242 “And we'll walk on the wall of China by moonlight, with Cleopatra and 
14245 “Certainly, madam,” said the man, who felt the question too direct for 
14248 “Has she been working slippers for the planet Ju-Ju-Jupiter yet?” asked 
14249 Purvis, eagerly, as he entered the room, heated, and flushed from the 
14255 And in strict obedience, the servants raised their fair burden, and 
14256 bore her from the room, after Nina, who led the way with an air that 
14259 “When she gets at Ju-Jupiter,” said Purvis to Kate, as they closed 
14260 the procession, “it's a bad symptom; or when she fancies she 's 
14265 “No; not Hec-Hecate, but Hecuba--Hecuba; then it's a month at least 
14268 “How dreadful!” said Kate. And certainly there was not a grain of 
14269 hypocrisy in the fervor with which she uttered it. 
14271 “I don't think she 'll go beyond the San-Sandwich Islands this time, 
14274 “Hush, Scroope!” cried Martha. And now they entered the small and 
14279 continued the while to exhibit a hundred petty signs of mute rebellion. 
14281 “Lady Hester wishes to see Miss Dalton,” said a servant at the outer 
14286 “Oh, of course, my dear Miss Dalton; let there be no ceremony with us,” 
14290 against so much wine; and then, turning to one of the servants, he added 
14291 a mild request for the two bottles that were left on the drawing-room 
14294 Martha happily, however, overheard and revoked the order. And now the 
14295 various attendants withdrew, leaving the family to themselves. 
14299 some of the signs of its recent ruin, and the servants were busied 
14301 comments, hushed as she went by, told her how the occurrence was already 
14302 the gossip of the household. It was impossible for her not to connect 
14303 herself with the whole misfortune. “But for her” But she could not 
14304 endure the thought, and it was with deep humiliation and trembling in 
14308 to the hairdresser, who had just completed one half of her Ladyship's 
14309 chevelure, leaving the other side pinned and rolled up in those various 
14311 them. Her cheek was flushed, and her eyes sparkled with an animation 
14314 “What is this dreadful story I 've heard, child, and that the house is 
14315 full of? Is it possible there can be any truth in it? Have these odious 
14316 people actually dared to establish themselves here? Tell me, child 
14322 “Not my Sevres jar? not the large green one, with the figures?” 
14326 “Go on. What then?” said Lady Hester, dryly. 
14328 “Shocked at the incident, and alarmed, besides, by the fall of a 
14331 perfectly accustomed, and pronounced not dangerous. In this dilemma they 
14332 asked me if they might occupy my room. Of course I could not refuse, and 
14333 yet felt, the while, that I had no right to extend the hospitality of 
14334 this house. I saw the indelicacy of what I was doing. I was shocked and 
14341 she, gulping to repress the torrent of suffering that was struggling 
14348 “Miss Dalton,” resumed Lady Hester, and as if not hearing the entreaty, 
14349 “very little knowledge of that world you have lived in for the past 
14351 in difficulty. Still less acquaintance with it might have suggested the 
14352 recollection that these people are no intimates of mine; so that, even

14358 mislead me, for I bethought me that although these persons were not of 
14359 your own rank and station, yet you had stooped lower than to them when 
14364 it quickly, and as suddenly the blood rushed to her cheek, coloring her 
14365 throat and neck with the deep crimson of shame. A burst of pride the 
14371 import. Perhaps for a moment the possibility of a deception struck her, 
14373 the unerring traits of truth, and said, 
14377 “Oh no, no!” said Kate, bursting into tears, and kissing the hand that 
14382 for, after all, I could forgive them the jar and the camellias, if they 
14383 'd only have gone away afterwards. And of course the lesson will not be 
14388 “Nonsense, child. The trick is the very stalest piece of roguery going. 
14389 Since Toe Morris, as they call him the man that treads upon people, and 
14390 by his apologies scrapes acquaintance with them there is nothing less 
14391 original. Why, just before we left England, there was old Bankhead got 
14392 into Slingsby House, merely because the newspapers might announce 
14393 his death at the Earl of Grindleton's 'on the eighth, of a few days' 
14394 illness, deeply regretted by the noble lord, with whom he was on a 
14396 of the world for a similar paragraph. I 'm sure I should know nothing of 
14399 your I was going to call them 'your friends,' the Rickettses.” 
14404 aspiring to some society above them. Besides, after all, I was in a 
14409 “Yes; Jekyl told me that if they once got in, it would be next to 
14410 impossible to keep them out afterwards. A compromise, he said, was the 
14411 best thing; to let them have so many days each year, with certain small 
14412 privileges about showing the house to strangers, cutting bouquets, and 
14413 so on; or, if we preferred it, let them carry away a Teniers or a Gerard 
14414 Dow to copy, and take care never to ask for it. He inclined to the 
14415 latter as the better plan, because, after a certain lapse of time, it 
14420 “And yet half the absurd and incongruous intimacies one sees in the 
14423 detestation. I 'm sure I don 't know one good house in town where there 
14424 are not certain intimates that have not the slightest pretension, either 
14425 from rank, wealth, distinction, or social qualities, to be there. And 
14426 yet, there they are; not merely as supernumeraries, either, but very 
14428 on questions of family policy, and writing their vulgar names on every 
14429 will, codicil, marriage-settlement, and trust-deed, till they seem to 
14430 be part of the genealogical tree, to which, after all, they are only 
14432 but, believe me, the system will outlive both of us. And so, now to your 
14435 shall be the better able to concert measures about these Ricketts folk, 
14436 who really resemble those amiable peasants your father told me of, 
14438 delighted that I have n't forgot the word.” 
14441 nature, sadly shaken as it had been by the contrarieties of the morning. 
14443 Ever better satisfied to look on the bright side of life, her 
14445 gloomy themes to pleasant ones; and already some of the absurdities 
14446 of the morning were recurring to her mind, and little traits of Mrs. 
14447 Ricketts and her brother were involuntarily coming up through all the 
14453 the company, and Kate looked forward to meeting these great personages 
14454 with no common interest. It was less the vulgar curiosity of observing 
14455 the manners and bearing of distinguished characters, than the delight 
14459 other in rapid succession. 
14468 as sacrifices to the opinion of the world. Few of her own peculiar set 
14469 were present. Some she omitted herself; others had begged off of their 
14470 own accord. Midchekoff, however, was there; for, however accustomed to 
14471 the tone and habits of a life of mere dissipation, he possessed every 
14475 pretensions always over-topped every other nobility. To oblige Lady 
14476 Hester, however, he did come, and condescended, for “the nonce,” to 
14478 of the days of the French Empire, but now a rigid devotee, and a most 
14480 smoothness of manner, with certain notabilities of the Court, made up 
14481 the party. There were no English whatever; Jekyl, who made out the 
14483 distinguished, except Norwood, whose temporary absence from the city 
14484 was rather a boon than the reverse; for the noble Viscount, when not 
14485 “slang,” was usually silent, and, by long intercourse with the Turf and 
14490 taste could contribute. The wines were delicious; the cookery perfect. 
14491 The guests were courteous and pleasing; but all was of the quietest, 
14492 none of the witty sallies, the piquant anecdotes, the brilliant 
14495 delinquencies furnish all the interest. The royal guest imposed a 
14496 reserve which the presence of the Cardinal deepened. The conversation, 
14497 like the cuisine, was flavored for fine palates; both were light, 
14498 suggestive, and of easy digestion. Events were discussed rather than the 
14499 actors in them. All was ease and simplicity; but it was a stately kind 
14501 So Kate Dalton felt it; and however sad the confession, we must own that 
14502 she greatly preferred the free and easy tone of Lady Hester's midnight 
14503 receptions to the colder solemnity of these distinguished guests. 
14505 Even to the Cardinal's whist-table, everything wore a look of state and 
14506 solemnity. The players laid down their cards with a measured gravity, 
14507 and scored their honors with the air of men discharging a high and 
14508 important function. As for the Archduke, he sat upon a sofa beside 
14509 Lady Hester, suffering himself to be amused by the resources of her 
14512 warmth that was kindled by the dinner-table seemed to have been chilled 
14513 by the drawing-room, where the conversation was maintained in a low, 
14516 sad-looking. The impassable barrier of reserve around them, if it 
14517 protect from all the rubs and frictions of life, equally excludes from 
14524 old courtiers pay as their rightful tribute to a young and handsome 
14527 was pursuing. Nor did the entrance of any new guest, a number of whom 
14528 had been invited for the evening, distract her from her half revery. 
14531 whom exhibited in their demeanor that respectful reserve the presence of 
14532 royalty ever inspires. It seemed, indeed, as though all the conversation

14537 respectful deference as they went. With some he deigned to speak a few 
14538 words, others had a smile or a little nod of recognition, and some

14542 family, the pursuits, and predilections of each new presentee. On the

14551 court by habits and manners which would not be tolerated in their own 
14553 and while his code of morality, on the whole, exhibited very merciful 
14555 the world's opinion. 
14557 To this Lady Hester had to listen as best she might, a task not the 
14558 less trying and difficult from the ill-suppressed looks of malice and 
14559 enjoyment she saw on every side. From all these causes put together, 
14560 the occasion, however flattering to her vanity, was far from being 
14562 Prince looked wearied enough, but somehow there is nothing like royalty 
14563 for endurance; their whole lives would seem to teach the lesson, and 
14567 It was the very culminating point of the whole evening's austerity; one 
14568 of those little pauses which now and then occur had succeeded to the 
14569 murmur of conversation. The whist party had been broken up, and the 
14570 Cardinal was slowly advancing up the room, the company, even to the 
14571 ladies, rising respectfully as he passed, when the folding-doors were 
14574 If the name was unknown to the assembled guests, there was one there 
14577 concealment. By this time the door had closed behind him, leaving Mr. 
14578 Purvis standing with an expression of no small bewilderment at the 
14581 Lady Hester's quick ear had caught the name, even from the furthest end 
14582 of the room; but while she attributed it to the mispronunciations of 
14587 put up his double eye-glass and commenced a tour of the rooms, in that 
14589 that all the faces were unknown to him seemed to impart additional 
14591 concern as he might have done in a theatre. 
14594 only of themselves and the awkwardness of their own position. Purvis, 
14595 on the contrary, had an eye for everything; from the chandeliers on the 
14596 walls to the crosses on the dress-coats, from the decorations of the 
14597 salons to the diamonds, he missed nothing; and with such impartial 
14598 fairness did he bestow his glances, that the Cardinal's cheeks grew red 
14599 as his own stockings as Scroope surveyed him. 'At last he reached the 
14600 end of the great drawing-room, and found himself standing in front of 
14601 the canopied seat where the Archduke sat with Lady Hester. Not heeding, 
14602 if he even remarked, the little circle which etiquette had drawn in 
14603 front of the Prince, Purvis advanced within the charmed precincts and 
14604 stared steadily at the Duke. 
14609 to you, Lady Hester,” said the Prince, with a very peculiar smile. 
14611 “I beg to assure you, sir, that the gentleman is unknown to me; his 
14625 emboldened by the complaisance, edged more closely towards him to point 
14626 out the lady in question. “She has a droll kind of sc-sc-scarf in her 
14627 hair. There! don't you see her now? Have you ever seen the pictures in 
14628 the Pitti Palace?” 
14630 The question was a little startling, as the personage to whom it was 
14631 addressed had his residence there. The Archduke, however, merely bowed 
14633 like it better than the Ti-Tit-Titian itself. We smoked it, too, and 
14636 To judge from the bewildered look of the Duke, the whole of this speech 
14638 explanation, he discovered that she had left her seat. Whether mistaking 
14639 the motion as an invitation to be seated, or merely acting by his own 
14640 impulses, Scroope crossed over and sat down on the sofa with a degree of 
14643 “You 're not one of the fa-family, are you?” asked he. 
14645 “I have not that honor,” said the Prince, with a bow. 
14647 “I thought not. I suspected that there was a tw-tw-twang in your English 
14652 “Pretty rooms, these,” said Purvis, with his glass to his eye; “what 
14653 a d-d-deal of money they must have cost! They 're going it fast, these

14659 se-se-serves us, and he won't give anything till they have sent their 
14660 orders; and as for wine, they drink Bordeaux in the servants' hall. 
14664 “Good wine, however, can be had here, I hope,” said the Duke, blandly. 
14667 while, to add poignancy to the remark, he nudged the Prince with his 
14668 elbow. “That's the only way to have it. The st-stupid Government sees 
14671 “Is that the case, sir?” asked the Prince, with a degree of interest he 
14682 we-weak in the a-a-attic story,” and here Scroope tapped his forehead 
14683 significantly, “but that 's in the family. My sister Zoe could tell you 
14684 such st-stories about them you 'd die of laughing; and then there 
14685 's Jekyl takes them off so well! It's c-c-capital fun. He gives a 
14686 dia-dia-dialogue between the Grand-Duke and the Pope's Nuncio that's 
14690 there is no saying, when Lady Hester came up, with Kate leaning on her

14700 she motioned towards another part of the room.

14704 'Dons,' with their stars and crosses.” And, without waiting for Kate's 
14710 other moment have overwhelmed Kate Dalton with shame; but now, whether 
14711 from the few words which Lady Hester had whispered in her ear, whether 
14712 the fact of his unauthorized appearance, or whether it were the dread of 
14714 the continuous flow of twaddle which he kept up as they passed down the 
14723 “Not now, pray, not now; at any other time,” cried she, in perfect 
14727 that I lost the op-op-opportunity; she wants to know him so very much.” 
14729 “Of course, at another time,” said Kate, hurrying him along with 
14737 “Not the fellow that st-st-strangled the Emperor? Oh, I forgot; he was a

14740 boubou-bouquets at the Casciui.” 
14744 “Is he, though? Then let's have another look at him. He has as many gold 
14745 chains about him as a shop on the Ponte Vecchio. Zoe would like him, he

14760 after all, you know, they are only b-bankers, these Onslows, and need 
14761 n't give themselves airs.” 
14766 it feels crisp like a note, a bank-note; that 's the reason you 're 
14767 impatient. Perhaps the re-reremittance was long a-coming, eh?” 
14777 such a droll ac-account of the whole family. Zoe recom-mended him; and 
14778 the poor fellow 's very grateful, for he writes about all that goes on 
14779 in the house. Lady G., it seems, has the temper of a f-f-fiend. Well, 
14780 don't be im-impatient; I'll find your father's letter in a minute. He 
14782 ta-take it that he 's a bit of a character, the old gen-gentleman. I 'm 
14784 it is! and 'with haste' written on the corner, too.” 
14786 Kate caught the letter impatiently, and, without any thought for Purvis 
14787 or the place, tore it open at once. In doing so, the enclosure fell to 
14788 the ground without her perceiving it; and, stranger still, it escaped 
14789 the attention of Purvis; but that worthy man, not exactly venturing 
14792 features during the perusal. 
14797 a chair, that is, if I can f-find one in this little den; they 've got 
14798 nothing but d-divans all round it.” And he hurried forth into the larger 
14802 various others that he at last succeeded, and returned to the boudoir 
14804 that Miss Dalton had made her escape in the mean while? In vain did 
14805 he seek her through the salons, which now were rapidly thinning; the 
14808 A stray group lingered here and there, conversing in a low tone; and 
14809 around the fires were gathered little knots of ladies muffled and 
14810 cloaked, and only waiting for the carriages. It was like a stage, when 
14811 the performance was over. Scarcely deigning to notice the little man, 
14813 quarter, they gradually moved off, leaving Purvis alone to tread the 
14814 “banquet-hall deserted.” The servants, as they extinguished the 
14819 As he passed along the galleries and descended the stairs, he made 
14820 various little efforts to open a conversation with some one or other of 
14821 the servants; but these dignified officials responded to his questions 
14822 in the dryest and shortest manner; and it was only as he reached the 
14823 great gate of the palace that he chanced upon one courteous enough to 
14824 hear him to the end in his oft-repeated question of “Who was th-th-that 
14825 with the large st-st-star on his breast, and a wh-wh-white beard?” 
14827 The porter stared at the speaker, and said respectfully, “The signor 
14828 probably means the Archduke?” 
14830 “Not the Archduke Fr-Fr-Fr--” 
14832 “Yes, sir,” said the man; and closed the heavy door after him, leaving

14839 If Lady Hester's grand company had gone, the business of the evening 
14840 was by no means over; on the contrary, it was the hour of her night 
14841 receptions, and now the accustomed guests of those favored precincts 
14842 came dropping in from theatres, and operas, and late dinners. These men 
14843 of pleasure looked jaded and tired, as usual; and, except the little 
14844 tinkling sounds of Jekyl's small treble, no other voice sounded as they 
14845 walked along the corridors. 
14849 When they entered Lady Hester's boudoir, they found that lady recounting 
14850 to Midchekoff the whole circumstances of the morning's adventure, a 
14851 recital which she continued without other interruption than a smile or 
14852 a nod, or a little gesture of the hand to each of the new arrivals as 
14853 he came in. If the lady's manner was devoid of all ceremony, that of the 
14854 gentlemen was less ceremonious still; for they stretched themselves on 
14855 divans, rested their legs upon chairs, and stood back to the fire, with 
14856 a degree of careless ease that bespoke them thoroughly at home, Jekyl, 
14857 perhaps, the only one present who mingled with this freedom a certain

14869 ridicule or malice are the provocatives.

14876 presented himself in the drawing-room. 
14879 judge from his face, it must have been something atrocious; and the last 
14887 “But what do you mean to do, my Lady?” asked Midchekoff. “Is the enemy 
14888 to hold undisputed possession of the fortress?” 
14895 “By all means,” said the others, who now formed a semicircle in front of

14902 “I should advise a protocol in the form of a protest. It is a palpable

14910 “Precisely, General, precisely a case in point,” rejoined the old 
14912 shortest road to victory is ever the best.” 
14914 “Let's try a fever, or a fire. By Jove! the sacrifice of a few chairs 
14920 “Lady Hester's troops to mount guard alternately with the Rickettses'. 
14921 Downright treason, base treason!” exclaimed another. 
14924 “It would at least serve to enlighten us as to the views of the enemy. 
14925 The discussion of the past often throws much light on the future.” 
14927 “Jekyl wants to earn a decoration,” said another, laughing. “He intends 
14928 to be the envoy himself.”

14934 “Well, let us hear it,” said the Prince, gravely. 
14936 “You would counsel the national expedient of retiring before the enemy, 
14937 and making the country too cold to hold them?” 
14940 a set of people who have had the impertinence to intrude themselves 
14943 “And yet Giasconi is right,” said the Prince. “It is the best suggestion 
14946 retreat, however, avoids either difficulty.” 
14948 “In that case, let 's starve them out,” said George. “Suffer no 
14949 supplies to be thrown into the place, and exact the most humble terms of

14954 “His Eminence expects to see you in Rome,” whispered the Abbe, who had 
14955 waited for an opportunity for the suggestion. “I believe he relies on a

14967 “There 's a little villa of mine, on the Lake of Como, very much at your 
14968 service,” said Midchekoff, with the easy indifference of one suggesting 
14971 “Do you mean La Rocca, Prince?” added the Sicilian. 
14974 The Empress passed a few weeks there last year, and liked it,” said 
14987 “This is Tuesday,” said Jekyl. “There 's not much to be done; the villa 
14990 “Ah, it's comfortable, then?” said the Prince, with a slight degree of

14999 that he was paying the most flattering compliment to Midchekoff in 
15000 naming the shortest possible time for preparation. 
15004 “No; not in the least. If Jekyl will precede you by a couple of hours, I 
15007 “With your permission, then, we will say Thursday,” said she, who, with 
15008 her habitual delight in novelty, was already wild with pleasure at the 
15017 “May we follow you, too, Lady Hester?” asked the Sicilian. 
15022 “There 's something or other inconvenient about the stables,” said 
15023 Midchekoff, “but I forget what it is; they are up a mountain, or down 
15024 in a valley. I don't remember it, but the Emperor said it was wrong, and 
15027 “They are on the opposite side of the lake, Prince,” interposed Jekyl, 
15031 joy, at the novelty. 
15034 from the water, for the mountain is quite inaccessible.” 
15036 “You shall have a road made, if you wish it,” said the Prince,

15046 “Oh! that's where they are, is it? I could never call to mind where they 
15050 of abode, the life they should all lead when on the lake, and the 
15052 departure. This same mystery was not the least agreeable feature of the 
15053 whole, and Lady Hester never wearied in talking of all the speculations 
15054 her new step was certain to originate; and although some of the company 
15055 regretted the approaching closure of a house which formed the resource 
15056 of every evening, others were not sorry at the prospect of anything 
15057 which offered a change to the monotony of their lives.

15070 ONE of the most striking characteristics of our present age is the 
15071 singular mixture of frivolity and seriousness, the almost absurd 
15073 the well-to-do classes. Never was there a period when merely sensual 
15075 time when every rank in life was more eager in the pursuit of knowledge. 
15077 and while the mere man of pleasure affected a taste for literature 
15078 and politics, the really active-minded either sought his relaxation, 
15085 whole temper of society and the tone of conversation exhibited this new 
15088 Lady Hester Onslow was not a bad specimen of the prevailing mania. There 
15095 but a feeble ally at the best. Her employment of the day was a type 
15097 doctor, or what she fancied were theological discussions with the Abbe 
15100 It would be difficult to say in which the imaginative exaltation more 
15101 predominated. All the authentic and incredible phenomena of the one, all 
15102 the miraculous pretensions of the other, were too little for a credulity 
15105 by which she meant narratives. “I will have no theories, doctor.” “Don't 
15109 Now, such facts as she asked for were easily obtainable, and the 
15110 greatest miser need not have grudged her an ample meal of them. Many 
15111 of the facts, too, possessed the pleasing feature of being personal in 
15112 their interest. One day it was a charming young patient of the doctor, 
15113 who, having touched a tress of Lady Hester's hair, made the most

15118 articles of jewelry, which she had not even seen at the time, and only 
15120 assured her of the intense interest taken in her by the Church. 
15122 the flattering addition that prayers were then being uttered at many 
15123 a shrine for her enlightenment in their perusal. Less asked to conform 
15124 herself to a new belief than to reconcile the faith to her own notions, 
15125 she was given the very widest latitude to her opinions. If she grew 
15127 sometimes a happy mot settled the question. The Abbe was a clever 
15128 talker, and varied his subjects with all the skill of a master. He 
15130 contribute. The theme was a grand one when the imagination was to be 
15131 interested, and really deserved a better listener; for save when the 
15132 miraculous interposition of saints or the gaudy ceremonials of the 
15133 Church were spoken of, she heard the subject with indifference, if not 
15137 his Holiness looked forward to the moment of counting her among his 
15142 her magnificence and splendor, her glorious cathedrals, the pomp and 
15143 grandeur of her ceremonial! As to music, the choir of the “Duomo” was 
15144 seraphic, and needed not the association of the dim vaulted aisles, the 
15145 distant altar, and the checkered rays of stained-glass windows to wrap 
15146 the soul in a fervor of enthusiasm. Even beauty was cherished by the 
15147 Church, and the fair Madonnas were types of an admiring love that was 
15150 With all this, the work of conversion was a Penelope's web, that must 
15151 each day be begun anew, for, as the hour of the Cascini drew nigh, Lady 
15153 the fresher interests of courtly loungers, chit-chat, and “bouquets of 
15156 For the next hour or so, her mind was occupied with the gossiping 
15157 stories of Florentine life, its surface details all recounted by the 
15158 simpering dandies who gathered around her carriage; its deeper not 
15159 unfrequently darker histories being the province of Mr. Albert Jekyl. 
15161 after the Opera, and it was then, somewhere verging on midnight, that 
15162 she really began to live. Then, in all the blaze of dress and jewels, 
15163 with beauty little impaired by years, and a manner the perfection of 
15167 Kate Dalton's life was, of course, precisely the same. Except the few 
15169 and the occasional change from driving to riding in the Cascini, Kate's 
15170 day was exactly that of her friend. Not, however, with the same results; 
15171 for while one was wearied with the same routine of unvarying pleasure, 
15172 tired of the monotonous circle of amusement, the other became each day 
15175 was not alone the splendor that surrounded her, the thousand objects of 
15176 taste and elegance that seemed to multiply around them, that captivated 
15177 her so much, it was the absence of all care, the freedom from every 
15178 thought that this state was a mere passing one. This Kate felt to be the 
15183 Her father's letter was the first shock to this delightful illusion. Her 
15186 she often passed hours, there rose to her mind the bitter self-accusings 
15187 of a penitent spirit. She never slept through the night; the greater 
15190 it is true, recall the penury and the privation, but not the feelings 
15191 that grew out of them. “How changed must he have become to stoop to 
15192 this!” was the exclamation that she uttered again and again. “Where was 
15193 all that Dalton pride they used to boast of? What become of that family 
15194 dignity which once was their bulwark against every blow of Fortune?” 
15196 To these thoughts succeeded the sadder one, of what course remained for 
15197 her to adopt? a difficulty the greater since she but half understood 
15198 what was required of her. He spoke of a bill, and yet the letter 
15199 contained none: before she broke the seal, it felt as though there was 
15200 an enclosure, yet she found none; and if there were, of what use would 
15203 revolted at the very thought. Still less could she apply to Lady Hester, 
15205 money; and yet to refuse her father on grounds which he would deem 
15206 purely selfish was equally out of the question. She well knew that in 
15207 a moment of anger and impatience stung by what he would call the 
15209 Stafford, narrating every circumstance that drove him to the step. Oh, 
15210 that she had never left him, never ceased to live the life of want and 
15211 hardship to which time had accustomed her! all the poverty she had ever 
15214 such a theme, her father would not scruple to renew the application 
15216 embarrassment, nor any difficulty for her in the matter; that it neither 
15220 Stafford. Were she to make the request and fail, he would order her 
15221 home, and under what circumstances should she leave the house of her 
15224 In such harassing reflections warring and jarring in her mind, the long 
15225 hours of the night were passed. She wept, too: the bitterest tears are 
15229 to have obtained her father's kind word, and at others all the indignity 
15233 Wearied and fevered, she arose and went into the garden. It was one of 
15234 the brilliant mornings which for a week or ten days in Italy represent 
15235 the whole season of spring. Although still early, the sun was hot, and 
15236 the flowers and shrubs, refreshed by the heavy dew, were bursting out 
15237 into renewed luxuriance in the warm glow. The fountains sparkled, and 
15238 the birds were singing, and all seemed animated by that joyous spirit 
15239 which seems the very breath of early morning, all save poor Kate, who, 
15240 with bent-down head and slow step, loitered along the walks, lost in her 
15243 To return home again was the only issue she could see to her 
15244 difficulties, to share the humble fortunes of her father and sister, 
15248 that all without its pale was ignoble and unworthy. No other course 
15250 adoption, when the short, quick step of some one following her made her 
15254 “I see with what care Miss Dalton protects the roses of her cheeks,” 
15255  said he, smiling; “and yet how few there are that know this simple 
15259 forgotten the sight of a rising sun, but this morning I did not feel 
15268 “Is not this yours, Miss Dalton?” said he, producing the bill, which had 
15269 fallen unseen from her father's letter. “I found it on the floor of the 
15270 small boudoir, and not paying much attention to it at the time, did 
15271 not perceive the signature, which would at once have betrayed the

15291 “What is the reason of this hurried departure?” 
15293 “The Ricketts invasion gives the pretext; but of course you know 
15294 better than I do what a share the novelty of the scheme lends to its

15304 thickening around her, and not a gleam of light shone through the gloomy 
15305 future before her. At last, as it were overpowered by the torturing

15318 would have retreated; but, the step once taken, the only course was 
15321 “Miss Dalton may reject my counsels, but she will not despise the 
15322 devotion in which they are proffered. A mere accident” here he glanced 
15323 at the paper which she still held in her fingers “a mere accident has 
15324 shown me that you have a difficulty; one for which neither your habits 
15325 nor knowledge of life can suggest the solution.” He paused, and a very

15328 suffice, I never would have ventured on the liberty. I, who have watched 
15330 shoals and reefs and quicksands, where the most skilful might have found 
15335 “Is it so plain, then, what all this means?” said Kate, holding out the 
15338 “Alas! Miss Dalton,” said he, with a faint smile, “these are no enigmas 
15339 to us who mix in all the worries and cares of life.” 
15341 “Then how do you read the riddle?” said she, almost laughing at the easy 
15346 won't pay, and he won't make them; his own creditors having no sympathy 
15348 angry, and they grow irritable; he makes his agent write to them, they 
15349 'instruct' their attorney to write to him. Mr. D. is puzzled, and were 
15354 “You'll not be offended, though?” said he, “because, if I have not the 
15359 “Very true; but I do not wish there should be even a trivial 
15364 “Where was I, then? Oh! I remember. I said that Mr. Dalton, seeing 
15365 difficulties thickening and troubles gathering, suddenly bethinks him 
15371 “Mr. Jekyl mistakes the part of a friend when he becomes flatterer.” 
15385 “Mr. Dalton knows there are thousands could have told him so that his 
15387 choose her rank and her nationality, and there is not a land in Europe 
15391 what all the world says behind your back. Hearing this, and believing 
15392 it, as all believe it, what is there more natural than that he should 
15395 reaches the zenith. Do not mistake me. This request was scarcely fair; 
15397 for such a mere trifle. Had your father but seen with his own eyes your 
15398 position here, he would never have done this; but, being done, there is 
15402 vexation together. 
15404 “Send the money, of course,” said he, coolly. 
15408 “Your own benevolence, none other,” said he, as calmly. 
15428 him the slight favor; but I could not counsel you to do so. Your 
15432 there is neither a difficulty nor a disclosure.” 
15439 “And if I should be unable to acquit the debt, will these few things I 
15442 “I should say double the amount, as a mere guess.” 
15449 Kate gave a slight shudder, as though that pang was greater than all the 
15452 “There is fortunately no difficulty in the matter whatever,” said Jekyl, 
15454 before you leave this. Well; take the carriage and your maid, and drive 
15455 to the Ponte Vecchio. The last shop on the right-hand side of the bridge 
15456 is 'Morlache's.' It is unpromising enough outside, but there is wealth 
15458 and in a few minutes the whole will be concluded; and if you have your 
15459 letter ready, you can enclose the sum, and post it at once.” 
15461 If there were many things in this arrangement which shocked Kate, and 
15462 revolted against her sense of delicacy and propriety, there was one 
15463 counterpoise more than enough to outweigh them all: she should be 
15464 enabled to serve her father, she, who alone of all his children had 
15466 materially assist him. She knew too well the sufferings and anxieties 
15467 his straitened fortune cost him, she witnessed but too often the 
15470 indulge in when an unexpected help had suddenly lifted him from the 
15471 depth of his poverty. To be the messenger of such good tidings to be 
15474 placed so palpably before her the promptitude with which the act could 
15476 at the appointed place by three o'clock that same afternoon. 
15480 shall drive out to Midchekoff's and make all the arrangements about the 
15481 villa. Till three, then, good-bye!” 
15483 “Good-bye,” said Kate, for the first time disposed to feel warmly to the 
15484 little man, and half reproach herself with some of the prejudices she 
15487 Jekyl now took his way to the stables, and ordering a brougham to be got 
15488 ready for him, sauntered into the house, and took his coffee while he 
15496 There is something of mediaeval look and air about the Ponte Vecchio 
15497 in Florence, which gives it a peculiar interest to the traveller. The 
15498 quaint little low shops on either side, all glittering with gold and 
15499 gems; the gorgeous tiaras of diamonds; the richly enamelled cups and 
15500 vases aside of the grotesque ornaments of peasant costume; the cumbrous 
15501 ear-rings of stamped gold; the old-fashioned clasps and buckles of 
15502 massive make; the chains fashioned after long-forgotten models; the 
15504 are all thrown about in a rich profusion, curiously in contrast to the 
15505 humble sheds for they are little more that hold them. 
15507 The incessant roll of equipages,--the crowd and movement of a great 
15508 city; the lingering peasant, gazing with rapturous eyes at the 
15509 glittering wares; the dark Israelitish face that peers from within; 
15510 the ever-flowing tide of population of every rank and age and country, 
15511 giving a bustle and animation to the scene, so beautifully relieved by 
15512 the view that opens on the centre of the bridge, and where, in a vacant 
15513 space, the Arno is seen wending peacefully along, and scattering its 
15514 circling eddies beneath the graceful arches of the “Santa Trinita,” that 
15515 little glimpse of hill and vineyard and river, the cypress-clad heights 
15516 of San Miniato, and the distant mountain of Vallombrosa, more beautiful 
15517 far than all the gold Pactolus ever rolled, or all the gems that ever 
15520 There was one stall at the end of the bridge so humble-looking and so 
15525 if to confirm the impression of the scanty traffic that went on, the 
15526 massive door was barred and bolted like the portal of a prison. An 
15528 this was the shop of “Racca Morlache.” 
15530 There may have been much of exaggeration in the stories that went of 
15531 the Jew's enormous wealth; doubtless many of the accounts were purely 
15533 sums sufficient to maintain the credit of many a tottering state, or 
15534 support the cost of warlike struggles to replace a dynasty. To him came 
15535 the heads of despotic governments, the leaders of rebellious democracy, 
15536 the Russian and the Circassian, the Carlist and the Cristino. To the 
15537 proud champion of divine right, or the fearless promulgator of equality, 
15539 could not dispense with; but, for the rest, in what channel of future 
15540 good and evil his wealth was to flow, whether to maintain a throne or 
15542 liberate a people or to bind their fetters more closely, were cares that 
15547 himself; nor, as the world goes, any society from which he should be 
15548 debarred, gold is the picklock to the doors of palaces as of prisons; 
15550 two centuries had never borne any other name than the “Casa Morlache.” 
15552 Various reasons were given out for a choice so singular; among others, 
15553 it was said that the Grand-Duke was accustomed to visit the Jew by means 
15554 of a secret passage from the “Pitti;” while some alleged that the secret 
15555 frequenters of Morlache's abode all came by water, and that in the dark 
15556 night many a boat skimmed the Arno, and directed its course to the last 
15557 arch of the Ponte Vecchio. With these rumors we have no concern, nor 
15560 When Kate Dalton had driven up to the door, she had all but determined 
15561 to abandon her intention. The arguments which in the morning had taken 
15563 herself for even the momentary yielding to Jekyl's counsels. Her only 
15564 doubt was whether to drive on without further halt, or leave some short 
15565 message, to the effect that she had called but could not delay there. 
15566 This seemed the better and more courteous proceeding; and while she was 
15567 yet speaking to the dark-eyed, hook-nosed boy who appeared at the door, 
15571 going to the palace, and we shall miss him.” 
15581 “That I have already told Morlache the whole story, and obtained his 
15582 promise for the loan.” 
15587 morning, the matter was fully agreed on between us; but still, if 
15593 “Not for the first time, be assured. Even Croesus looked up from his 
15596 investment!' But stay; there is Purvis yonder. He is pretending to 
15598 there only en vedette.” 
15600 “What shall I do?” exclaimed the poor girl, now torn by impulses and 
15601 emotions the most opposite. 
15603 “One thing you must do at once,” said Jekyl; “get out of the carriage 
15604 and visit two or three of the shops, as if in quest of some article of 
15605 jewelry. His anxiety to learn the precise object of your search will 
15609 Kate that she at once descended, and took Jekyl's arm along the bridge. 
15610 They had not gone many yards when the short, little, shuffling step of 
15611 Purvis was heard behind them. Lingering to gaze at some of the splendid 
15612 objects exposed for sale, they at last reached a very splendid stall, 
15614 And now Purvis had stationed himself exactly behind them, with his head 
15615 most artistically adjusted to hear everything that passed between them. 
15618 even turning his eye from the glass case, said, in a voice of some 
15625 scheme, she was not the less eager to be free of the presence of the 
15629 brilliants, “would not go ill with the necklace, although the stones are 
15630 smaller. Say something, anything,” added he, in a lower tone; “the spell 
15636 “So it is,” said Jekyl, quickly. “Let us see what value they place upon 
15637 it. Oh, here is Mr. Purvis; how fortunate! Perhaps in all Florence there 
15639 as an old resident, happily exempt from all the arts and wiles played 
15643 of the bl-bl-blunder I made last night about the Ar-Archduke?” 
15652 chatelaine yonder, with a large emerald pendant; could you ascertain the 
15654 you, which they would, assuredly, if she entered the shop.” 
15664 that very little more would make the scene unendurable to Kate. 
15666 “I hope it 's not an It-It-Italian fellow; for they 're all as poor as 
15673 theme, never paid any attention to what was said by others. 
15678 temper; and at last Purvis yielded, and entered the shop. 
15682  And with these words he hurried her along, laughing, in spite of all her 
15683 anxieties, at the absurdity of the adventure. “He 'll see the carriage 
15684 when he comes out,” added he, “and so I 'll tell the coachman to drive 
15685 slowly on towards the Pitti.” And thus, without asking her consent, he 
15686 assumed the full guidance at once; and, ere she well knew how or why, 
15687 she found herself within the dark and dusty precincts of Morlache's 
15693 neat little chamber on the level of the Arno, the window opening on the 
15696 seemed communicated from the stream to the apartment, which Jekyl at 
15698 depressing the chamber with the changes in the current of the river; 
15699 otherwise the room must have been under water for a considerable portion 
15700 of the year. While he descanted on the ingenuity of the mechanism, 
15701 and pointed attention to the portraits along the walls, the Kings and 
15702 Kaisers with whom Morlache had held moneyed relations, the minutes 
15704 against time, the figety nervousness of his manner, and the frequent 
15705 glances he bestowed at the timepiece, showing how impatiently he longed 
15706 for the Jew's arrival. To all Kate's scruples he opposed some plausible 
15708 of the loan; that the visit might be as one of mere curiosity, to 
15709 see some of those wonderful gems which had once graced the crowns of 
15710 royalty; and that, in any case, the brief delay would disembarrass them 
15711 on the score of Purvis, whose spirit of inquiry would have called him 
15712 off in some other direction. At last, when now upwards of half an hour 
15713 had elapsed, and no sound nor sight bore token of the Jew's coming, 
15715 patiently for a few minutes, he left the room. 
15718 terrified her; the minutes, as she watched the clock, seemed drawn out 
15721 there. To this state of almost feverish excitement succeeded a low 
15722 and melancholy depression, in which the time passed without her 
15723 consciousness; the half-dulled sounds of the city, the monotonous plash 
15724 of the stream as it flowed past, the distant cries of the boatmen 
15725 as they guided their swift barks down the strong current, aiding and 
15726 increasing a feeling that was almost lethargic. Already the sun had sunk 
15727 below the hills, and the tall palaces were throwing their giant shadows 
15728 across the river, the presage of approaching night, and still she sat 
15729 there all alone. Jekyl had never returned, nor had any one descended the 
15730 stairs since his departure. Twice had she shaken off the dreamy stupor 
15731 that was over her, and tried to find the door of the chamber, but, 
15732 concealed in the wainscoting, it defied her efforts; and now, worn out 
15733 with anxiety and disappointed, she sat down beside the window, gazing 
15734 listlessly at the water, and wondering when and how her captivity was to 
15737 The lamps were now being lighted on the quays, and long columns of light 
15738 streaked the dark river. Across these a black object was seen to glide, 
15740 against the current, and headed up the stream. As she watched, it came 
15741 nearer and nearer; and now she could hear distinctly the sound of voices 
15743 making for the centre arches of the bridge, the boat was vigorously 
15744 impelled across the river, and its course directed towards the very 
15748 It was clear there were persons coming; in another moment she would 
15750 there, and thus exposed to every surmise and suspicion that chance 
15753 these were as nothing to the misery which coming events seemed full of. 
15754 For a second or two she stood irresolute, and then with something like 
15755 an instinct of escape, she stepped out upon the little terrace that 
15756 supported the flowers, and, trembling with fear, took her stand beneath 
15757 the shadow of one of the great buttresses of the bridge. The frail and 
15759 her feet rolled along the dark river, with a low and sullen sound like 
15760 moaning. Meanwhile the boat came nearer, and slowly gliding along, was 
15761 at last brought up at the window. Two figures passed into the chamber, 
15762 and the boatmen, as if performing a long-accustomed task, rowed out a 
15763 few lengths into the stream to wait. 
15765 From the window, which still remained open, a stream of light now 
15766 issued, and Kate's quick hearing could detect the rustling sound of 
15767 papers on the table. 
15769 “There they are,” said a voice, the first accents of which she knew to 
15770 belong to the Abbe D'Esmonde. “There they are, Signor Morlache. We have 
15771 no concealments nor reserve with you. Examine them for yourself. You 
15772 will find reports from nearly every part of the kingdom; some more, some 
15773 less favorable in their bearings, but all agreeing in the main fact, 
15774 that the cause is a great one, and the success all but certain.” 
15776 “I have told you before,” said the Jew, speaking in a thick, guttural 
15778 cause is good, every bankrupt one the reverse, in my estimation.” 
15782 “Ay, who are the committee?” interrupted the Jew, hastily. 
15784 “The committee contains some of the first Catholic names of Ireland, men 
15785 of landed fortune and great territorial influence, together with several 
15786 of the higher clergy.” 
15790 “The bishops, almost to a man, are with us in heart; but their peculiar 
15791 position requires the most careful and delicate conduct. No turn of 
15792 fortune must implicate them, or our cause is lost forever.” 
15794 “If your cause be all you say it is, if the nationality be so strong, 
15795 and the energies so powerful as you describe, why not try the issue, as 
15796 the Italians and the Hungarians are about to do?” said Morlache. “I 
15797 can understand a loan for a defined and real object, the purchase of 
15799 understand how the lender, too, could calculate his risk of profit or 
15800 loss on the issue of the struggle; but here you want half a million 
15804 to the fold of the Church the long-lost sheep; and make Ireland, as she 
15805 once was, the centre of holy zeal and piety!” 
15808 with a bitter laugh. “You must try other arguments with me; and once 
15810 their lives in the venture?” 
15812 “Have I not told you what and who they are who form this party?” said 
15813 D'Esmonde, passionately. “Read those papers before you. Study the secret 
15814 reports sent from nearly every parish in the kingdom. In some you will 
15815 find the sworn depositions of men on their death-beds, the last words 
15816 their lips have uttered on earth, all concurring to show that Ireland 
15817 has no hope save in the Church. The men who now stir up the land to 
15818 revolt are not devoid of courage or capacity. They are bold, and they 
15819 are able, but they are infidel. They would call upon their countrymen 
15820 in the name of past associations, the wrongs of bygone centuries; they 
15821 would move the heart by appeals, touching enough, Heaven knows, to the 
15822 galling sores of serfdom, but they will not light one fire upon the 
15823 altar; they will not carry the only banner that should float in the van 
15824 of an Irish army. Their bold denouncings may warn some; their poetry 
15825 will, perhaps, move others; but their prose and verse, like themselves, 
15827 village churchyard, or a prisoner's plaint sent over the sea from a land 
15830 “England is too powerful for such assailants,” said the Jew. 
15832 “Very true; but remember that the stout three-decker that never struck 
15833 to an enemy has crumbled to ruin beneath the dry rot,” said D'Esmonde, 
15834 with a savage energy of manner. “Such is the case now. All is rot and 
15836 nobles, more tolerant as the commonalty grows more ambitious; resources 
15837 diminishing as taxation increases; disaffection everywhere, in the towns 
15838 where they read, in the rural districts where they brood over their 
15839 poverty; and lastly, but greatest of all, schism in the Church, a mutiny 
15841 these the evidences of strength, or are they sure signs of coming ruin? 
15844 These men will have the same fate as Tone and Emmet, without the 
15845 sympathy that followed them. They will fail, and fail egregiously; but 
15847 a priest will join them. On the contrary, their scheme will be denounced 
15848 from our altars; our flocks warned to stand aloof from their evil 
15849 influence. Our bishops will be in close communication with the heads of 
15850 the Government; all the little coquetries of confidence and frankness 
15851 will be played off; and our loyalty, that's the phrase, our loyalty 
15854 demeanor form the contrast to that rampant intolerance that assails us.” 
15857 need no money; such nobility of soul is, after all, the cheapest of 
15863 guide, it is the embodiment of public opinion, without which men would 
15864 never clothe their sentiments in fitting phrase, or invest them with 
15865 those short and pithy apothegms that form the watchwords of party. 
15866 Happily, if it be great, it is venal; and although the price be a 
15867 princely ransom, the bargain is worth the money. Fifty or a hundred 
15869 advocates; some, in assumed self-gratulation over their own prescience, 
15870 in supporting our claims in time past, and reiterating the worn 
15871 assertion of our attachment to the throne and the constitution; others, 
15872 to contrast our bearing with the obtrusive loyalty of Orangeism; and 
15873 others, again, going further than either, to proclaim that, but for 
15875 stood in the breach, the cause of rebellion would have triumphed.” 
15877 “And is this character for loyalty worth so much money?” said the Jew, 
15881 quickly; “but if the tree be stunted, its fruits are above price. Our 
15882 martyrdom will not go unrewarded. The moment of peril over, the season 
15883 of concessions will begin. How I once hated the word! how I used to 
15884 despise those who were satisfied with these crumbs from the table of the 
15885 rich man, not knowing that the time would come when we should sit at the 
15886 board ourselves. Concession! the vocabulary has no one word I 'd 
15887 change for it; it is conquest, dominion, sovereignty, all together. By 
15889 Now, my good Signor Morlache, these slow and sententious English are 
15890 a most impulsive people, and are often betrayed into the strangest 
15894 “And what is the game?” said the Jew, with impatience; “for it seems to 
15895 me that you are not about to strike for freedom, like the Hungarians or 
15896 the Lombards. What, then, is the prize you strive for?” 
15898 “The Catholicism of Ireland, and then of England, the subjugation of the 
15899 haughtiest rebel to the Faith, the only one whose disaffection menaces 
15900 our Holy Church; for the Lutheranism of the German is scarce worth the 
15901 name of enemy. England once Catholic, the world is our own!” 
15903 The enthusiasm of his manner, and the excited tones of his round, full 
15904 voice seemed to check the Jew, whose cold, sarcastic features were 
15905 turned towards the priest with an expression of wonderment. 
15908  said Morlache, after a long pause. “What securities are offered for the 
15909 repayment of this sum? for, although the theme be full of interest to 
15910 you, to me it has but the character of a commercial enterprise.” 
15912 “But it ought not,” said D'Esmonde, passionately. “The downfall of the 
15914 were in times past, they may become again. The supremacy of the seas 
15915 once wrested from that haughty power, the long-slumbering energies of 
15916 Southern Europe will awaken, the great trading communities of the Levant 
15917 will resume their ancient place, and the rich argosies of the East once 
15918 more will float over the waters of the tideless sea.” 
15920 “Not in our time, Abbe, not in our time,” said the Jew, smiling. 
15923 your own great forefathers raised the glorious Temple?” 
15925 The allusion called up but a cold sneer on the Israelite's dark 
15929 A tap at the door here broke in upon the colloquy, and Jekyl's voice was 
15930 heard on the outside. 
15936 I followed you to the 'Pitti,' I left a young lady here, has she gone 
15943 the stairs again. 
15945 “The night air grows chilly,” said the Abbe, as he arose and shut the 
15946 window; and the boatmen, mistaking the sound for a summons to approach, 
15947 pulled up to the spot. 
15949 With a sudden spring Kate bounded into the boat, while yet some distance 
15950 off, and hurriedly said, “To the stairs beside the Santa Trinita.” 
15952 The clink of money, as she took out her purse, made the brief command 
15953 intelligible, and they shot down the stream with speed. 
15956 she stepped from the boat; and a gold Napoleon enforced the caution. 
15958 It was now night, the lamps were all lighted, and the streets crowded by 
15961 the footway was wet and muddy. Dressed in the height of fashion, all her 
15964 with patched and threadbare cloak, had she travelled the dark road from 
15966 of danger nor of insult occurring to her happy spirit, the “Gute nacht” 
15967  of some homeward-bound peasant the only sound that saluted her. But now, 
15968 she was no longer in the secluded valley of the great Vaterland; her 
15969 way led through the crowded thoroughfares of a great city, with all its 
15972 If, in her wild confusion, she had no thought for each incident of the 
15977 secret? and, lastly, what answer return to her poor father's letter, 
15978 that letter which was the cause of all her misfortunes? 
15981 will detail the whole events of this morning, and he shall see that my 
15982 failure has not come of lukewarmness. I will also strive to show him the 
15983 nature of my position, and let him know the full extent of the sacrifice 
15984 he would exact from me. If he persist, what then? Is it better to go 
15985 back and share the poverty I cannot alleviate? 
15988 I wish them to be otherwise? Alas, I cannot tell; I do not even know my 
15991 of the priest, D'Esmonde, but the last scene in which he figured made 
15992 her shrink with terror from the man of dark intrigues and secret wiles. 
15993 She even thought of poor Hanserl, who, in all the simplicity of his 
15995 'Go back; return to the humble home you quitted; put away all the 
15997 Take, once more, your lowly place at hearth and board, and forget the 
16000 have not tasted the intoxicating cup, to say, 'Be cool of heart and 
16001 head!' Nor am I what I was. How then go back to be that which I have 
16003 again in the dreamland of the poets that we loved so well, and wander 
16004 with dearest Nelly through those forest glades, peopled with the 
16006 theirs, and how unlike the real one!” 
16008 Thus, lost in thoughts conflicting and jarring with each other, mingling 
16009 the long past with the distant future, hoping and fearing, now seeking 
16010 self-persuasion here, now controverting her own opinions there, she 
16011 walked hurriedly on, unconscious of the time, the place, and even the 
16013 admiration. What an armor is innocence! how proof against the venomed 
16014 dart of malice? Kate never knew the ordeal through which she was 
16015 passing. She neither saw the looks nor heard the comments of those 
16016 that passed. If her mind ever turned from the throng of thoughts that 
16017 oppressed it, it was when some momentary difficulty of the way recalled 
16018 her to herself; for, as she escaped from the smaller streets, the crowd 
16022 “Does this lead to the Piazza Annunziata?” asked she of a woman at a 
16025 “Tell her, Giacomo,” said the woman to a youth, who, with a water-melon 
16026 in his hand, lay at full length on the pavement. 
16028 “Per Baccho! but she 's handsome!” said he, holding up the paper lantern 
16037 a single contrariety in the long catalogue of annoyances which had not 
16039 had admitted every bore of her acquaintance, while, to the few she 
16041 approaching departure had got wind through the servants, and the 
16042 hall and the courtyard were crowded with creditors, duns, and begging 
16045 balance, had given each other a general rendezvous that morning at the 
16048 It is well known how the most obsequious tradespeople grow peremptory 
16050 courteousness with which they receive “your Ladyship's orders” undergoes 
16051 a terrible change. Departure is the next thing to death. Another country 
16052 sounds like another world. The deferential bashfulness that could not 
16053 hint at the mention of money, now talks boldly of his debt. The solvent 
16057 All the little cajoleries and coquetries, all the little seductions and 
16061 yourself transformed into a dubious debtor. All the halo that has 
16064 a whisper in the hall, now grew clamorous in the antechamber; and more 
16065 than once did they actually obtrude themselves in person within those 
16070 all these “tiresome creatures”? Was there no one who knew what to do? 
16072 these people could be telling the truth; the greater number, if not all 
16073 of them, must have been paid already, for she had spent a world of 
16075 effect, which had a result the very opposite to what it was intended; 
16076 and now the noisy tongues and angry accents grew bolder and louder. 
16077 Still none came to her rescue; and she was left alone to listen to the 
16078 rebellious threatenings that murmured in the courtyard, or to read 
16079 the ill-spelled impertinences of such as preferred to epistolize their 
16082 The visitors who found their way to the drawing-room had to pass through 
16083 this motley and clamorous host; and, at each opening of the door, the 
16086 More than once she bethought her of Sir Stafford; but shame opposed the 
16087 resolution. His liberality, indeed, was boundless; and therein lay 
16088 the whole difficulty. Were the matter one for discussion or angry 
16091 unequal to an act of submission. Among the numerous visitors who now 
16092 thronged the salons, Lord Norwood, who had just returned from his 
16093 shooting excursion in the Maremma, was the only one with whom she had 
16099 and superscription as well as though I had seen him affix them. The very 
16111 “Out the whole day!” 
16113 “And the 'Dalton'? for she has rather a good head, if I don't mistake 
16116 “She took the carriage into town, and has not returned.” 
16120 or two, and that these people were so pestering and pressing, and all 
16126 “So much the better; he'll come down all the readier now.” 
16136 “To be sure I can--there are twenty ways to do the thing. Close the 
16139 the company are at supper. You lose the spoons and forks, to be sure; 
16140 but that can't be helped. You might try and bully them, too though 
16142 raise a few hundreds, and pay them each something.” 
16144 “But how or where raise the money?” 
16147 was the fellow that invented bills. The glorious philanthropist that 
16148 first devised the bright expedient of living by paper, when bullion

16163 “Here 's the patent treasury for pocket use the 'Young Man's Best 
16165 blank bill-stamps, together with a mass of acceptances of various kinds, 
16166 the proceeds of various play debts, the majority of which he well knew 
16168 for?” said he, seating himself, pen in hand, at the table. 
16171 confusion. “There are all these people's accounts and letters. I suppose 
16172 they are all horrid cheats. I 'm sure I never got half the things, and 
16173 that the rest are already paid for. But no matter now; let us have done 
16174 with them at any cost.” 
16178 patent axles, and replacing English varnish by the lacquer of a tea-tray 
16198 “Pardon me. I know these people somewhat better and longer than you do; 
16209 “Nearly one thousand pounds!” exclaimed she. “Say, rather, eleven 
16216 “We are getting deeper and deeper,” said Norwood, turning over the 
16217 bills. “Contardo, the wine-merchant, and Frisani, table-decker, are both 
16218 large claimants. If pine-apples were the daily food of the servants' 
16219 hall, they could scarcely cut a more formidable figure in the reckoning, 
16220 indeed, if the whole establishment did nothing but munch them during all 
16221 their leisure hours, the score need not be greater. Do you know, Hester, 
16222 that the rogueries of the Continent are a far heavier infliction than 
16223 the income-tax, and that the boasted economy of a foreign residence is 
16224 sensibly diminished by the unfortunate fact that one honest tradesman 
16225 is not to be found from Naples to the North Pole? They are Spartans in 
16226 deceit, and only disgraced whenever the rascality is detected. Now, it 
16232 be told that these people are all knaves; their character for honesty is 
16234 of them and learn all his secrets. I only wish to get rid of them, it 
16235 's very distressing to hear their dreadful voices, and see their more 
16236 dreadful selves in the court beneath.” 
16241 them, and see what can be done.” 
16243 “Do so, then, and lose no time, for I see Midchekoff s chasseur below, 
16244 and I 'm sure the Prince is coming.” 
16246 Norwood gave her a look which made her suddenly become scarlet, and then 
16247 left the room without speaking. 
16249 If he had not been himself a debtor with the greater number of those who 
16250 waited below, few could have acquitted themselves more adroitly in such 
16253 to apply to them, when to soothe and when to snub them. All these 
16254 arts he was both ready and willing to exercise, were it not for the 
16257 playing advocate with one leg in the dock.” 
16259 He lingered a little, therefore, as he went; he stopped on the landing 
16260 of the stairs to peep out on the tumultuous assemblage beneath, like 
16261 a general surveying the enemy's line before the engagement; nor was he 
16263 the crowd, note-book and pencil in hand, palpably taking evidence and 
16264 storing up facts for future mention. As he was still looking, the 
16266 travel-stained, was whirled into the court by three steaming and panting 
16269 as to the meaning of the assembled throng, entered the house. 
16271 Curious to learn who, what, and whence the new arrival came, Norwood 
16272 hurried downstairs; but all that he could learn from the postilion was 
16273 that the stranger had posted from Genoa, using the greatest speed all 
16274 the way, and never halting, save a few minutes for refreshment. The 
16275 traveller was not accompanied by a servant, and his luggage bore neither 
16277 and that he had gone direct to Sir Stafford's apartments, was the whole 
16278 sum of the Viscount's knowledge; but even this seemed so worthy of 
16279 remark that he hastened back with the tidings to Lady Hester, instead of 
16282 She treated the announcement with less interest. It might be Proctor, 
16286 Genoa, there was one there, or in Nice, she forgot exactly which, who 
16288 precisely, but it was certainly one or the other. On recollection, 
16294 “Yes, poor man, much worse. George sat up with him the night before 
16301 “You forget, my Lord, that there are other considerations than moneyed 
16310 indeed, to forget it. Yet I should have fancied it was the very 
16311 sentiment uppermost in the mind of any one entering this chamber, 
16312 witnessing the solitary seclusion of my daily life, beholding the 
16313 resources by which the weary hours are beguiled, not to speak of the 
16314 ravages which sorrow has left upon these features.” 
16326 and down the room with impatience. “You 'll stay and meet him, Norwood. 
16328 He left us t' other day to entertain the Prince alone, Kate and 
16330 occasionally won't speak for a whole evening together, my part was a 
16334 more agreeable to your Ladyship than the Midchekoff,” said he, slowly 
16339 “What? are you really serious? Has the Dalton pretensions?” 
16341 “Perhaps not; but the Prince has,” interrupted Lady Hester. “But you 
16342 are forgetting these people all the while. Do pray do something anything 
16343 with them; and don't forget us at eight o'clock.” And with this Lady 
16344 Hester hurried from the room, as if admonished by her watch of the 
16345 lateness of the hour, but really anxious to escape further interrogatory 
16346 from the Viscount. 
16348 When Norwood reached the court, he was surprised to find it empty; not 
16349 one of the eager creditors remained, but all was still and silent. 
16351 “What has become of these good people?” asked he of the porter. 
16353 “The stranger who arrived in the caleche awhile ago spoke a few words to 
16354 them, and they went.” 
16358 their eyes, his present communication was remarkable. 
16360 “Would that the good genius had remembered me in his moment of generous 
16364 Little scrupulous about the means of getting out of a difficulty, 
16365 provided it were only successful, Norwood scarcely bestowed another 
16366 thought upon the whole matter, and lounged along the streets, as 
16367 forgetful of the late scene as though it had passed twenty years before. 
16369 As the Viscount strolled along towards his lodgings, Kate Dalton, with 
16370 trembling limbs and palpitating heart, threaded her way through the 
16372 was falling. So long as her road lay through the less-frequented 
16373 thoroughfares, her appearance excited little or no attention in the 
16374 passers-by; but when she entered the Piazza Santa Trinita, all ablaze 
16375 with gas-lamps and the reflected lights from brilliant shops, many 
16376 stopped, turned, and gazed at the strange sight of a young and beautiful 
16377 girl, attired in the very height of fashion, being alone and afoot at 
16378 such an hour. Unaccountable even to mystery, as it seemed, there was 
16379 something in her gait and carriage that at once repelled the possibility 
16380 of a disparaging impression, and many touched or removed their hats 
16381 respectfully as they made way for her to pass. To avoid the carriages, 
16383 passed close along by the houses; and, in doing so, came within that 
16384 brilliant glare of light that poured from the glass doors of the great 
16385 Cafe of the Piazza. It was exactly the hour when the idle loungers of 
16386 Florence society that listless class who form the staple of our club 
16387 life in England were swarming to talk of the plans of the evening, what 
16389 The drizzling rain, and the cold, raw feeling of the air prevented their 
16390 being seated, as their custom was, before the doors, where in every 
16391 attitude of graceful languor they habitually smoked their cigars and 
16392 discussed the passersby, in all the plenitude of recreative indolence. 
16396 and fortune, others as destitute of character as of means. Many owned 
16397 names great and renowned in history; others bore designations only 
16398 chronicled in the records of criminal jurisprudence. All were well 
16399 dressed, and, so far as cursory notice could detect, possessed the ease 
16400 and bearing of men familiar with the habits of good society. Although 
16401 mixing in very distinct circles, here, at least, they met every day on 
16402 terms of familiar equality, discussing the politics of the hour and the 
16403 events of the world with seeming frankness and candor. 
16405 From a small chamber at the back of the cafe, a little tide of loungers 
16406 seemed to ebb and flow; while the sharp rattling sound of a dice-box 
16407 indicated the nature of the occupation that went forward there. The 
16408 small apartment was thronged with spectators of the game; and even 
16409 around the door several were standing, content to hear the tidings of a 
16410 contest they could not witness. 
16412 “To sit upon the Ponte Carraja, and chuck rouleaux of gold into the 
16413 Arno, would be to the full as amusing, and not a more costly pastime,” 
16414  said a sharp, ringing voice, which, once heard, there was no difficulty 
16417 “But Onslow plays well,” said another. 
16419 “When he's in luck, sir,” said the Colonel. “Let him always have the 
16420 winning horse to ride, and I don't say he 'll lose the saddle; but 
16426 mother was a Finlander, and the father a Cephalonian. I don't think 
16430 the door. “Onslow has no chance with him.” 
16434 game, and knows the use of every weapon, from a jereed to a Joe Manton.” 
16436 “I 'll not test his abilities at any of them,” said the other, laughing. 
16438 “_Per Baccho!_ there goes something new,” said a young Italian, from the 
16439 window that looked into the street. “Who's she?” 
16441 “_Diantre!_” said the old Duc de Parivaux. “That is something very 
16445 “She's the prima donna from Milan.” 
16447 “She 's the Cipriani. I know her figure perfectly.” 
16449 “She 's very like the Princesse de Raoule.” 
16453 “And fifty times handsomer. What eyes! By Jove! I wish the drosky would 
16454 never move on! She is regularly imprisoned there.” 
16456 “You are very ungallant, gentlemen, I must say,” said the young Count 
16457 de Guilmard, the French secretary of legation, who, having finished his 
16458 coffee and liquor, coolly arranged his curls beneath his hat before the 
16461 saying, he passed out into the street, while the rest pressed up closer 
16462 to the window to observe his proceedings. 
16465 protected her from the pole of that carriage.” 
16472 “But he hasn't, though.” Amid all these phrases, which rattled on more 
16473 rapidly than we can write them, Onslow joined the party, one heavy 
16477 “If so, the entente cordiale with France seems scarcely so secure as 
16480 Onslow gave one glance through the window, and dashed into the street 
16481 with a bound like the spring of a wild animal. He threw himself between 
16482 Guilmard and Kate. The Frenchman lifted his cane, and the same instant 
16483 he fell backwards upon the pavement, rather hurled than struck down 
16484 by the strong arm of the young Guardsman. Before the lookers-on could 
16488 So sudden was the whole incident, and so engrossing the terror of 
16490 conscious that by George's opportune coming she was rescued from the 
16491 insolent attentions of the stranger. 
16497 and struggled against the emotion that almost choked her. 
16502 although my courage never failed me till you came, then I thought I 
16514 “I did take a carriage in the morning; and and--” 
16517 drive to, where pass the day?” 
16525 where you have been, and with whom? So, then, you refuse to speak, you 
16533 “And can you not confide it to me? Have I no right to ask for the 
16542 “Let me know, at least, enough to refute the insolence of an imputation 
16543 upon your conduct. I cannot tamely sit by and hear the slanderous 
16544 stories that to-morrow or next day will gain currency through the town.” 
16548 “If not me, then, choose some other defender. Unprotected and undefended 
16554 insulted in the open street?” 
16557 minutes her sobs alone were heard in the silence. 
16560 as the carriage passed under the arched gateway of the Palace, “and then 
16562 your own sole keeping; or is your confidence shared in by another?” 
16572 dashing open the door of the carriage as it drew up to the house. He 
16573 gave his hand to Kate to alight, and then, turning away, left her, 
16580 “Mademoiselle must have been too pleasantly engaged to remember the 
16581 hour,” said the other, with an easy pertness quite different from her 
16584 More struck by the tone than by the words themselves, Kate turned a look 
16585 of surprise on the speaker. 
16587 “It is so easy to forget one's self at Morlache's, they say,” added the 
16588 girl, with a saucy smile; and although stung by the impertinence, Kate 
16589 took no notice of the speech. “Mademoiselle will of course never wear 
16590 that dress again,” said Nina, as she contemptuously threw from her the 
16595 “Nina, what do you mean by these strange words and this still more 
16597 assumed towards the girl. 
16599 “I do not pretend to say that Mademoiselle has not the right to choose 
16600 her confidantes, but the Principessa de San Martello and the Duchessa di 
16601 Rivoli did not think me beneath their notice.” 
16604 through all the dark mystery of her words, saw the lowering storm of 
16609 honored me with their secret confidence; and they did wisely, too, for I 
16614 disdain, “and if I have no need either of the counsels or the discretion 
16619 to pass three hours at Morlache's, and returns thence, on foot, after 
16620 nightfall, may truly say she has no secrets, at least, so far as the 
16633 herself between Kate and the door. “My tongue is oftentimes too ready, 
16638 over mine; pass out of that door as my enemy, and I am yours to the last 
16641 There was a strange and almost incongruous mixture of feeling in the way 
16642 she uttered these words; at one moment abject in submission, and at the 
16644 The conflict of the girl's passion, which first flushed, now left her 
16645 pale as death, and trembling in every limb. Her emotion bespoke the most 
16648 compassion at the excited features and heaving bosom of the Spanish 
16654 “Be it so, Mademoiselle,” replied the other, with a courtesy. 
16659 “The Prince will have thought it an hour, Mademoiselle,” said the girl; 
16660 the quiet demureness of her manner depriving the words of any semblance 
16662 source of pleasure lay hid within her heart; and in the glance she gave 
16663 at her glass, there was an air of conscious triumph that did not escape 
16664 the lynx-eyed Nina. 
16667 at the door; and Kate, with many a trouble warring in her breast, 
16668 hastened downstairs, in all the pride of a loveliness that never was 
16675 KATE found Lady Hester, the Prince, and Mr. Jekyl awaiting her as she 
16676 entered the drawing-room, all looking even more bored and out of sorts 
16677 than people usually do who have been kept waiting for their dinner. 
16682 unavoidable delay detains him; and here comes Miss Dalton, the mirror 
16683 of punctuality when all else are late, a full half-hour after the time. 
16685 the thousand calls you 've made, and shops you 've ransacked. I 'm 
16690 rattled in the head of a Dutch doll. Even as he gave his arm to lead 
16692 secret understanding between them. A bystander might have deemed him a 
16695 “Petits diners” have, generally, the prerogative of agreeability; they 
16696 are the chosen reunions of a few intimates, who would not dilute their 
16697 pleasantry even by a single bore. They are also the bright occasions for 
16699 sphere. Epigrams, whether of lamb or language, require a select and 
16700 special jury to try them; but just in the same proportion as the success 
16701 of such small parties is greater, so is their utter failure, when by any 
16702 mischance there happens a breakdown in the good spirits or good humor of 
16703 the company. 
16705 We have said enough to show that the ladies, at least, might be excused 
16707 centre on the one great quality, ease of mind. The Prince was more than 
16709 to him during the morning. A great sovereign, on whom he had lavished 
16710 the most profuse attentions, had written him a letter of thanks, through 
16712 an autograph, and the first class of the national order. His glover, in 
16713 Paris, had forgotten to make his right hand larger than the left, and a 
16716 unlucky morsel the Cardinal had helped himself to at breakfast, and 
16719 just come out in the ballet, a piece of insolence and rebellion on 
16720 his part not to be tolerated; and when we add to these griefs an 
16721 uncomfortable neckcloth, and the tidings of an insurrection in a 
16726 as any of the rest. If the ocean he sailed in was not a great Atlantic, 
16731 any over-effort to compensate for the lack of co-operation in others, 
16732 and thus make their silence and constraint but more palpable, his 
16733 pleasantry was tinged with the tone of the company, and all his little 
16734 smartnesses were rather insinuated than spoken. Quite satisfied if the 
16735 Prince listened, or Lady Hester smiled, more than rewarded when they 
16736 once both laughed at one of his sallies, he rattled on about the Court 
16737 and the town talk, the little scandals of daily history, and the petty 
16738 defections of those dear friends they nightly invited to their houses. 
16739 While thus, as it were, devoting himself to the amusement of the others, 
16740 his real occupation was an intense study of their thoughts, what was 
16741 uppermost in their minds, and in what train their speculations were 
16742 following. He had long suspected the Prince of being attracted by Kate 
16744 be flattered on every hand, and to receive the blandest smiles of beauty 
16746 such seductions; and had Kate followed the path of others, and exerted 
16748 actual indifference her perfect carelessness on the subject was the 
16752 Too proud of her own Dalton blood to feel any elevation by the marked 
16753 notice of the great Russian, she merely accorded him so much of her 
16755 designed flattery could have been so successful. Another feeling, also, 
16757 which seemed to sway all his actions, to desire the possession of 
16759 stamps but one, and breaks the die, these were a passion with him. To 
16762 painted but one; but whether it were a gem, a vase, a weapon, a diamond, 
16764 Now, Kate Dalton realized these conditions more than any one he had 
16768 fierte about her that distinguished her among other women. All that he 
16770 capable of effecting in the simplest costume and without an effort. All 
16771 these were wonderful attractions to his eyes; and if he did not fall in 
16773 to him served as substitute for the passion; he coveted an object which 
16774 should form one of the greatest rarities of his collection, and the 
16775 possession of which would give him another title to that envy, the most 
16776 delicious tribute the world could render him. 
16782 his best, by sundry allusions to Irish greatness, and the blood of 
16783 various monarchs of Munster and Conuaught, in times past; but the Prince 
16784 was incredulous as to Hibernian greatness; probably the remembrance of 
16787 above every detracting influence, and he thought of the pride in which 
16791 never would have hesitated about the acquisition. Marriage, however, was 
16793 cost more than mere money. Nothing but the possibility of losing her 
16794 altogether could have overcome this cautious scruple; and Jekyl had 
16798 intercourse might effect? There was Norwood, too, with the rank of 
16799 peeress in his gift; there was no saying how an ambitious girl might 
16800 be tainted by that bait.” In fact, the Prince had no time to lose; and, 
16804 If we have dwelt thus long upon the secret thoughts of the company, 
16805 it is because their conversation was too broken and unconnected for 
16807 occasional allusion to some social topic, a chance mention of their 
16809 scenery, formed the whole; and then, in spite of Jekyl, whose functions 
16810 of “fly-wheel” could not keep the machine a-moving, long pauses would 
16812 conversation. All this while Jekyl seemed to be reading the complex 
16814 Midchekoff's mind. The stealthy glances of the Russian's eyes towards 
16815 Kate, the almost painful anxiety of his manner, to see if she noticed 
16817 and gesture, told Jekyl the struggle that was then passing within him. 
16818 He had seen each of these symptoms before, though in a less degree, 
16819 when the coveted object was a horse or a picture; and he well knew how 
16820 nothing but the dread of a competition for the prize would rouse him 
16828 “I say, Jekyl,” whispered he, as they retired out of earshot of the 
16829 others, “here's a pretty mess Onslow's got in. There has been a fracas 
16830 in the street about Miss Dalton. How she came there at such a time, and 
16831 alone, is another matter; and George has struck Guilmard, knocked him 
16832 down, by Jove! and no mistake; and they're to meet tomorrow morning. Of 
16833 course, there was nothing else for it; a blow has but one reparation, 
16834 George will have to stand the fire of the first shot in Europe.” 
16836 Jekyl hated a duel. Had he been a member of the Peace Congress, he could 
16837 not have detested the arbitrament of arms more heartily. 'It involved 
16839 often closed up for a whole season the pleasantest houses of a town. The 
16841 with more terror. To Norwood the prospect was directly the opposite. Not 
16842 only an adept in all the etiquette and ceremonial of such meetings, he 
16843 liked to see his name circulated in these affairs as a kind of guarantee 
16846 opportunity of sustaining the prestige of a “dead shot.” 
16848 It was, then, with an ardor of amateurship that he narrated the various 
16849 little preliminary steps which had already been taken. Merkheim, the 
16850 Austrian secretary, had called on him, on the part of Guilmard; and as, 
16851 in a case so clear, there was little to arrange, the only difficulty lay 
16852 in the choice of weapons. 
16854 “The Frenchman claims the sword,” said Norwood; “and it is always 
16856 has about as much chance with one weapon as the other.” 
16860 “I think so. If the offence had been less flagrant or less public, 
16861 possibly not. But a blow! to be struck down in the open street! I don't 
16865 head in the direction of the drawing-room. 
16867 “It will send them all back to England, I suppose.” 
16872 half-dozen of George's acceptances, not due yet; and, of course, the 
16873 governor will never think of acquitting them.” 
16875 “I conclude it is inevitable the meeting, I mean?” said Jekyl. 
16877 “To be sure it is. Onslow took care of that! By the way, Jekyl, how came 
16878 she there at such an hour, and alone, too?” 
16880 “She had been shopping, I fancy, and missed the carriage. There was some 
16881 blunder, I have heard, about the coachman drawing up at the wrong door.” 
16888 “You know the whole story from beginning to end, Jekyl. I 'd back you 
16889 against the field, my boy.” 
16891 The other shook his head with an air of supreme innocence. 
16893 “Then George knows it?” added Norwood, half asserting, half asking the 
16899 the room. “As his friend in this affair, there should be no reserve or 
16906 “Come, there is something you can tell me. Where does that small 
16907 corridor behind George's apartment lead to? There is a door at the end 
16915 “Why so, my Lord?” asked Jekyl, whose curiosity was now excited to the 
16920 “But the door is always locked and bolted from within,” said Jekyl, “and 
16921 there is no keyhole on the outside.” 
16928 discovery was valueless. And yet, if it concerned Kate in any way, the 
16938 “How do you mean, Jekyl? Is there any truth in that story about the 
16939 Irish property? Has she really a claim on the estate? Tell me all you 
16940 know, old fellow, and I 'll be on the square with you throughout.” 
16942 Jekyl, who in his remark had darkly alluded to the prospect of Kate's 
16944 his meaning, and like a shrewd tactician, determined to profit by the 
16951 pledge my word of honor to the truth of what I say, or, what your 
16954 “By Jove! that is news!” said the Viscount, leaning his head on the 
16958 fair damsel a peeress, is there no hitch in the affair no screw loose 
16963 “No; d--n her birth! I mean about the tin.” 
16965 “I believe, my Lord, that I can save you all speculation on the subject 
16966 when I say that pursuit would be hopeless there. The Midchekoff has 
16967 gained the start, and must win in a canter.” 
16970 never marry anything under royalty; the fellow's mother was a serf, and 
16976 “Refuse him!” said Norwood, laughing, “there's not that girl in Europe 
16978 stripe of the knout upon his back, his wealth would cover all.” 
16985 to have? nay, nay, man, there 's no impertinence in the question, we are 
16986 both too much men of the world for that. It 's quite clear that this is 
16987 your scheme. Now, what 's the damage?” 
16993 we come back to the original question, whether I cannot afford to be 
16994 as liberal as the Russian. Only be explicit, and let us understand each 
16995 other.” 
17000 And before Norwood could detain him he left the room. 
17003 the cur,” muttered the Viscount, “with his hypocritical affectation as 
17006 Norwood walked noiselessly to the door of the salon and peeped in. 
17007 Lady Hester, the Prince, and Jekyl were in earnest conversation in 
17010 the bright tints before her. Norwood entered listlessly, and strolling 
17011 across the room, took a place beside her. She moved slightly as he drew 
17012 forward his chair, and, then, as she drew back her flounce, Norwood 
17014 wherein he had deposited the torn fragment, and, regarding it with 
17015 attention, saw that it perfectly corresponded with the dress. So 
17030 for my taste; I like these fine and delicate tissues, so frail and 
17031 gossamer-like, not but their frailty, like all other frailty, incurs 
17040 others goes by the name of cleverness. It 's a great pity,” said he, 
17041 looking down at the dress; “you see, Miss Dalton, what a false step can

17049 “None,” said she, blushing at the pertinacity with which he clung to the 
17050 theme; “but it's of no consequence.” 
17053 her memory? Would she accept the service as kindly as it was proffered, 
17059 “And yet,” said he, following out the thread of his own thoughts, “I am 
17064 “And certainly,” resumed he, “the man who speaks in his own name should 
17067 “My Lord,” said she, firmly, “the very little which I can understand of 
17074 to be candid when I am frank. We two, united, would walk over the

17077 still, as to rank, a peer of Great Britain, I take it, is the equal of 
17078 any man. Not to remind you of the old adage about 'a bird in the hand' I 
17095 make way, while he still barred the passage. A proud, disdainful smile 
17096 was all the reply she vouchsafed. 
17099 Dalton, and whenever you want to repair the mischance of your lace 
17100 flounce, don't forget the piece is in my keeping;” and he opened the 
17101 pocket-book as he spoke, and exhibited the fragment before her. Sick 
17102 with a terror she could neither explain nor realize, she lay back again 
17104 the room. 
17107 Kate now perceived was alone on the sofa, Midchekoff and Jekyl having 
17108 retired into an adjoining gallery, where they walked slowly along, side 
17125 said. 'You 'll see that girl in a wonderful position one of these days.' 
17126 It is not that men care for their wives more than formerly, I rather 
17127 fancy the reverse, but they have got a most intense passion just now for 
17128 beauty. Wealth and good blood were once the only requisites, but they 
17129 are both disregarded now, in comparison with good looks. I suppose the 
17131 is the mode one ought to profit by it. Just as I am wearing all those 
17133 crimson and yellow, now that the taste in dress is 'rococo,' but of 
17134 course in a year or two people will recover their senses again, and 
17135 pretty girls without portions be left for sub-alterns in the line, as 
17136 Providence intended they should. Don't you think so, dear?” 
17138 The brief question at the end of this long rambling speech would 
17143 and they'll quote Heaven knows what instances of girls, generally Irish 
17145 Don't believe a word of it, dearest; there 's never misery where there 
17147 tears, that don't hurt the skin or spoil the complexion. Not that I can

17159 It was only the other night Lady Grace Morton kept her seat when the 
17161 he said, with such a sweet smile, 'If these Protestants would only give 
17162 us back our churches, we 'd forgive their keeping their chairs.' The mot 
17163 was very pretty, in French, and well turned was n't it? Of course, then, 
17164 you 'll make no obstacle about the Greek Church, which I believe is 
17165 exactly like your own, only that the priest has a beard, which I think 
17166 more becoming. It looks affectionate, too; it always gives one the idea 
17168 this tiresome age we live in, a new religion is the only new thing one 
17169 ever hears of. Your excellent family that sweet sister and the dear old

17188 Russian service. He 'll have him named an officer in the Emperor's 
17190 yourself. They tell me it 's the sweetest spot in the world; and I

17211 two long and two short, and a pl-pl-plait for the back of the head. How 
17214 “I must say that you have the strangest mode of requiting hospitality,” 
17218 brought on coughing, which, after a violent struggle, ended in the 
17219 forced utterance of the last syllable of the word, but with such fatigue 
17224 “Less good-natured persons would find another word for it, Mr. Purvis.” 
17226 “So they would. Haggerstone called it a Ricketty stratagem. No 
17227 matter; we 're in ha! ha! ha! and he 's out. The pr-pr-proof of the

17268 servants' hall when the fl-flunkeys were feeding, and such w-w-waste, 
17272 he could interpose a word, she hastened from the spot, and, passing 
17273 rapidly up the stairs, gained her own room, leaving Purvis to bethink 
17274 him over the mass of things he had not touched upon, and on which he had 
17282 LET us go back a few hours in our history, and follow the short and 
17283 burly figure which, emerging from the travelling-carriage in the 
17284 courtyard of the palace, pushed his way through the noisy throng of 
17285 duns, and entered the house. 
17294 “How is he, man, how 's the gout?” 
17310 the merest trifles, and he that never wanted attendance is now always 
17311 complaining that he 's neglected, and deserted and forsaken by all the 
17314 “Does the Captain come often to see and sit with him?” 
17316 “Every day, sir; but these visits do rather harm than good. Sir Stafford 
17317 is vexed at what goes on in the house; and Master George, I don't know 
17318 how it is, but he don't calm him down, and they have oftentimes angry 
17319 words together; not but my master is frequently in the wrong, and 
17320 taxes the young gentleman with what he can't help; for you see, sir, my 
17326 “He makes me read to him every day, sir, all about the money-market 
17329 'No, Proctor, let's have the City article again.'” 
17331 “And his letters does n't he read them?” 
17333 “The Captain reads them for him, sir; and now and then writes the 
17342 “Are there no inquiries after his health?” 
17344 “Yes, sir; there's plenty of people he used to give money to when he was 
17345 up and about poor actors, and painters, and the like they come every 
17346 day to know how he is. Some of them leave begging letters, which I never

17352 this side of the house at all.” 
17362 “What are all these people outside, who are they?”

17369 your master great injury were he to overhear them. Say that everything 
17373 Proctor hastened out on his errand, and the doctor sat down and covered 
17379 When Proctor returned, he proceeded to detail, for the doctor's 
17380 information, the various events which had occurred during his absence. 
17381 With most, Grounsell was already acquainted, and listened to the 
17384 “So it is, so it is,” muttered he to himself; “there may be more cant 
17386 assuredly, these things do not happen with us as we see them here. There 
17387 would seem a something enervating in the very air of the land, that a 
17396 Perhaps it would be better I should see the Captain first.” 
17404 Proctor accompanied the doctor across the courtyard, and, guiding him up 
17405 a small stair, reached the terrace off which George Onslow's apartment 
17406 opened. The window-shutters of the room were not closed, nor the 
17407 curtains drawn; and in the bright light of several candles that shone 
17409 in examining the details of a case of pistols which lay before them. 
17412 with you at twelve.” And thus saying, he gently pushed him towards the 
17413 door of the terrace, which he closed and bolted after him, and then 
17417 the spy. It was a part he thoroughly detested, nor did he think that it 
17418 admitted of defence or palliation; still, the whole habit of his mind 
17420 The limited sphere of his duties, the humble routine of his daily walk, 
17421 and the very few friendships he had inspired, all tended to increase 
17423 only be useful by the sacrifice of personal feeling and the abnegation 
17424 of all self-esteem; and thus he would have declined to know another 
17426 thinking too well of others, but thinking too meanly of himself. 
17429 letters littered the floor and the table; the embers of a large fire of 
17430 papers lay on the hearth; open drawers and boxes stood on every 
17431 side; all betokening preparation, the object of which the pistol-case 
17432 sufficiently indicated. As they sat with their backs to the window, 
17433 Grounsell could not recognize the figures; but the voice of one 
17436 “And where is this place on the way to Arezzo?” asked he. 
17438 “No; on the opposite side of the city, off the high-road to Bologna. It 
17439 is a little park, surrounding a summer palace of the Grand Duke, they 
17440 call Pratolino,” said the other. “They all agree that it is the best 
17442 capital breakfast of fresh trout to be had at the inn.” 
17447 “I never saw a Frenchman who had not, on such an occasion,” rejoined the 
17448 other, snapping the pistol as he spoke. “I like these straight stocks; 
17453 rising and pacing the room with folded arms. 
17455 “You 've written to the governor?” 
17458 severity that the other never seemed to notice. “You're quite safe, 
17461 “Hang it, man, I wasn't thinking of that; curse the money, it never 
17464 “My father will pay it,” said George, dryly, and continued his walk. 
17472 to let this mystery continue, or do you think that, under the 
17477 does. That there are circumstances which she does not deem fitting to 
17485 “That she means to take the Russian, that's all.” 
17490 “What's the use of all this fencing, man?” said Norwood, half angrily, 
17491 “I know better how matters stand. Do you remember the night you lost so 
17492 heavily at Macao? Well, I was lying stretched on the sofa, yonder, by 
17493 the light of the fire only, when the door opened, and she stepped gently 
17500 had, here is the proof that could condemn her, this fragment of her lace 
17501 flounce was caught in the door as she banged it in her escape; and this 
17502 very evening I compared it with the dress in question; ay, and showed 
17503 her the rent from which it came.” 
17505 Twice did George compel Norwood to repeat over this story; and then sat 
17508 “You swear to me, then, Onslow, that you never saw her here, never knew 
17509 of her coming?” said he, after a long silence between them. 
17511 “Never, I swear!” said the other, solemnly. 
17513 “Then, some other is the fortunate man, that's all. How good if it 
17514 should turn out to be Jekyl!” And he laughed heartily at the absurdity 
17515 of the conceit. 
17517 “No more of this,” said Onslow, passionately. “The tone of the society 
17520 than the facility of our belief in them. In this instance, however, my 
17521 conscience is at ease; and I reject, with contempt, the possibility of a 
17525 George,” said the Viscount, sarcastically. 
17527 “But as you are about to stake your life on the issue, I cannot impugn 
17530 A hasty movement of George towards the window here alarmed Grounsell, 
17531 and he noiselessly withdrew, and descended the stairs again. 
17534 passed across the courtyard. “Debt, duelling, and sickness, such are 
17535 the pleasures that welcome me; and these not the worst, perhaps, if the 
17536 causes of them were to be made known!” 
17539 the kindness to step up to her room,” said Proctor, coming to meet him. 
17545 “No matter; give the answer I tell you; or stay perhaps it would be 
17546 better to see her. Yes, Proctor, show me the way.” And muttering to 
17548 followed the servant up the stairs. 
17551 Grounsell was yet unprepared for the gorgeous decorations and splendid 
17552 ornaments of the chambers through which he passed, and he stopped 
17554 probably rather heightened than diminished by the uncertain light of the 
17555 candles the servant carried. He peered at the china vases; he passed his 
17556 hand across the malachite and jasper tables; he narrowly inspected the 
17557 rich mosaics, as though doubtful of their being genuine; and then, with 
17559 A bust of Kate Dalton the work of a great sculptor, and an admirable 
17562 but still the cold marble had caught up, in traits sterner than those of 
17563 life, the ambitious bearing of the head and the proud elevation of the 
17567 unlike poor Nelly's model! how different from the simple and beauteous 
17571 musings. And he followed her into the chamber, where, seated in a deeply 
17572 cushioned chair, Lady Hester reclined, dressed in all the perfection of 
17575 Grounsell was, assuredly, not the man to be most taken by such 
17576 attractions, yet he could not remain entirely insensible to them; and he 
17578 a woman's quickness, her Ladyship saw the effect she had produced, and 
17579 languidly extending her hand, she vouchsafed the nearest approach to a 
17582 and, scarcely touching the taper and jewelled fingers, he bowed 
17603 encounter. They were old antagonists, and well knew each other's mode 
17604 of attack. On the present occasion, however, Grounsell did not seek a 
17605 contest, and was satisfied by a single shot at the enemy, as if trying 
17606 the range of his gun. 
17618 Grounsell merely handed her a smelling-bottle from the table, and went 
17622 they must be considerable. He will be fortunate if there remain to him 
17627 The doctor rose, and sprinkled her forehead with water, and then 
17628 patiently sat down with his finger on her wrist to watch the returning 
17633 domestic arrangement, together with the proceeds of the sale of all the 
17636 opposed. George can exchange into a regiment in India; the proper steps 
17642 “I have seen one at Ramsgate, madam,” replied he, dryly; “but the rent 
17646 emphasis on the pronoun. 
17652 forgotten her share in these transactions?” 
17655 herself is not guilty of this forgetfulness, wherein she makes the very 
17667 fortune can bring no heavier infliction than the prospect of your 
17670 “You may not need them, madam. In adversity,” said Grounsell, with 
17672 saying, he bowed and left the room. 
17674 For a few moments Lady Hester sat overwhelmed by the tidings she had 
17675 just heard, and then, suddenly rising, she rang the bell for her maid. 
17678 immediately,” said she. “This may be the last time we shall speak to 
17679 each other ere we invert our positions,” muttered she to herself. And 
17680 in the working of her features might be read all the agony of the 
17688 How like the great world is every little section of it! How full of 
17690 struggles! Within the Mazzarini Palace that night were at work every 
17691 emotion and sentiment which sway the wide communities of men; and hope 
17692 and fear, the yearnings of ambition, and the gloomy forebodings of 
17693 despair, sat beside the pillows of those who, in vain, sought sleep and 
17697 was little less. Kate had yielded, to the pressing entreaties of Lady 
17699 George Onslow stole to his father's bedside to see him once more, 
17700 perhaps for the last time. It would be difficult to say in which of 
17701 those three hearts the darkest sorrow brooded. With noiseless step and 
17702 cautious gesture, George crossed the little sitting-room, and entered 
17703 his father's chamber; and, without awaking the servant, who kept watch 
17704 habitually without, but now had dropped off to sleep, he gained the 
17708 Stafford's brain, and, despite all the influence of his opiate, still 
17711  he muttered from time to time, and the tears rolled down the young man's 
17712 cheek as he heard them. 
17716 I have spent in noisy dissipation and debauch; and now I come for the 
17717 first time, and probably the last! Oh, my poor father! How will you bear 
17718 up against the shock that is preparing for you? for, with all my faults, 
17719 I know how you have loved me!” A heavy tear dropped from him on the old 
17727 “But a few minutes. I am so sorry to have disturbed you,” muttered the 
17728 other, in confusion, 
17735 “The saddest, perhaps, one friend can bring another,” sighed Onslow, 
17742 “Good heavens, father! is your brain wandering? What fancies are these 
17745 “Sad and stern truths, my poor boy,” replied the old man, grasping his 
17746 son's hand in his fevered palm. “A few weeks more will see the great 
17750 great crash has fallen upon the moneyed interest of England. The vast 
17751 speculations in railways have overreached themselves; failures of great 
17752 houses abroad have added to the difficulty. The correspondents whose 
17755 the ports of the Baltic to the distant shores of the New World, there is 
17759 beyond the reach of these casualties.” 
17762 did, could I exercise the privilege of retaining it, George,” said the 
17763 old man. “From what Grounsell tells me, there will be sufficient to meet 
17769 you at once of the new path before you. Arouse yourself, then, to the 
17771 the wild waves of adversity, and fighting the manful part of a bold, 
17772 courageous spirit, than I have ever been in seeing you in the brilliant 
17773 circle of all your high and titled acquaintances. Ay, George, the 
17774 English merchant never died out in my heart, for all the aristocratic 
17776 in the pride of wealth accumulated by generous enterprises and honorable 
17777 toil. I loved the life of labor that disciplined the faculties, 
17778 and exercised not alone intelligence, but turned to use the gentler 
17779 charities of life, linking man to man, as brethren journeying the same 
17780 road, with different burdens, perhaps, but with the same goal. For 
17781 myself, therefore, I have few cares. It remains with you to make them 
17787 “First of all, George, you ought to leave the army. Grounsell, I must 
17789 in India, but I think differently. To repair, if it be possible, the 
17791 life and habits. You 'll have to visit the West Indies, and, probably, 
17792 the East. We still possess property in Ceylon, of value; and our coffee 
17793 plantations there, as yet only in their infancy, need nothing but good 
17796 The English pluck that storms a breach or heads a charge is the very 
17797 same quality that sustains a man on the long dark road of adverse 
17798 fortune. I have often told Grounsell that the stuff was in you, George.” 
17800 The young man squeezed his father's hand, but was obliged to turn away 
17801 his head to hide the tears which filled his eyes; for what a terrible 
17803 there even in the silence with which he heard him! 
17805 For a few seconds Sir Stafford seemed to revel in all the bright visions 
17807 to have momentarily lifted him above the reach of sorrow. He thought of 
17808 his son engaged in the active business of life, and displaying in this 
17809 new career the energies and resources of a bold and courageous spirit. 
17810 He imagined the high-principled youth becoming the British merchant, and 
17811 making the name of “Onslow” great and respected in the old arena of all 
17812 their victories, the city of London. Could this but come to pass, were 
17813 this dream to be realized, and he would bless the hour that wrecked his 
17814 fortune, and thus made his poverty the foundation of future greatness. 
17817 knew you better than others did, and that I read in the very wayward 
17818 caprices of your disposition the impatience of an active mind, and not 
17819 the ennui of an indolent one.” From this the old man branched off into 
17820 his plans for the future; and, as if the emergency had suggested energy, 
17823 that very day. Some weeks would elapse before the crash came, and in the 
17826 such as they are, they will not seek to humiliate me, I trust, by any 
17827 unnecessary publicity.” The theme was a very painful one, and for a few 
17832 continued these habits of wasteful excess. Let these troops of idle 
17834 off all equipage. Take no heed of what will be the town talk; such a 
17840 It was quite true George heeded little of what his father spoke; for, 
17841 with bent-down head, he was trying to catch the sounds of what seemed 
17842 a long, low whistle from the court without. As he listened, the whistle 
17846 “I must leave you, my dear father,” said he, assuming all that he could 
17859 “The greater the pollution of such acquaintanceship, then,” said the old 
17860 man, gravely. “To see the dark side of such a nature, and yet live 
17861 under its baneful shadow, is infinitely worse, George, than all the 
17863 beseech you, let it be for the last time in such company.” 
17865 Again the whistle was heard, and with the sharp crack of a whip, 
17867 secret, George clasped the old man's hand fervidly within his own, and 
17871 harnessed, and with lamps lighted, for the morning was still dark, “is 
17873 Our time is six sharp, and it is now considerably past five, and the way 
17876 “I have often done the distance in half an hour,” said George, angrily. 
17878 “Perhaps the errand was a pleasanter one,” rejoined Norwood, laughing; 
17879 “but jump in, for I feel certain the others are before us.” 
17882 companion. The late scene with his father and the approaching event were 
17884 from what it was; but in reality never had he experienced the 
17885 same dislike for the Viscount. All the flippant ease, all the cool 
17887 thoughts were traversing the whole current of his life, from earliest 
17889 And thence arose to his mind the judgments men would pass upon him, the 
17890 few who would speak charitably, the still fewer who would regret him. 
17895 penetrate through that dark atmosphere of mystery and malevolence the 
17896 world will throw over the event!” 
17898 Norwood was provoked at the silence, and tried in various ways to break 
17899 it. He spoke of the road, the weather, the horse's trotting action, 
17900 the scenery, over which the breaking day now threw fitful and uncertain 
17902 spitefully pointed attention to a little valley beside the road, and 
17903 said, “Do you see that spot yonder, near the pine-trees? that 's where 
17904 Harry Mathews was shot. Malzahn sent the bullet through the brain 
17905 at forty paces. They were both first-rate pistol-shots, and the only 
17907 shot, and he carried the privilege into the other world with him. 
17908 Malzahn knew he might trust his skill, and fired the very instant he 
17912 “I heard the sound of wheels behind us; who are they?” said George, not 
17913 heeding either the story or the counsel. 
17915 “The doctor, I suspect. I ordered a calessino to wait for him at the 
17916 door of the palace, and bring him up as fast as possible.” 
17921 “Who can tell? We 'll put you up at a short distance; and there 's 
17922 nothing shakes the nerves of your practised pistol-shot more than ten or 
17925 The road here became so steep that they were obliged to get down and 
17926 walk for some distance, while the horse toiled slowly up behind them. As 
17927 they went, Norwood continued to talk on incessantly of this, that, and 
17928 t' other, as though bound to occupy the attention of his companion; 
17932 “We 're not far off the place now, George,” said Norwood, at last, “and 
17935 and take the thing as I have seen you take it before, as rather good fun 
17936 than otherwise.” 
17940 to bestow on me, with the prospect of an ample fortune before me, I was 
17941 perfectly ready to turn out with any man who had the right to ask me; 
17947 “Now that my father is on the verge of utter ruin,” repeated George, 
17948 slowly, “the news came last night, I never felt the desire of life so 
17950 so I may tell you that we have not escaped the torrent that is sweeping 
17951 away so many of the richest houses in Europe; and what between our 
17952 immense liabilities and my father's scrupulous sense of honor, the 
17956 own claims on George, and the unpaid acceptances he still held of his. 
17963 Norwood started, and turned his keen eyes on the other, but in the calm, 
17967 “Yes, I wish the Count's hand would shake a little, Norwood. I 'd be 
17968 most grateful to the bullet that would take to the right or the left of

17977 in this instance admitted of an apology, if there were any way to come 
17984 to others, and in what way my death might occasion detriment and 
17988 laughing; “and perhaps it is fortunate for you there is no amende 
17991 “As to these acceptances,” said George, not paying attention to what the 
17992 other said, “I 'd prefer that they should not be presented to my father 
17993 under our actual circumstances. My horses and carriages, and some other 
17994 trumpery of mine, when sold, will more than meet them, and I have given 
17998 a tone of friendship, suggested by the self-satisfaction the promise of 
17999 payment afforded him. “But, hush! There they are, all together. Let us 
18000 talk no more of these matters; and now, George, for Heaven's sake, be 
18003 Norwood drew the other's arm within his own as he said this, and 
18005 beside a low balcony, overlooking the Val d'Arno and the graceful valley 
18007 forward and saluted the company. Nothing could possibly be more easy and 
18008 unconstrained than the tone of their conversation, as they chatted away 
18009 about the prospect beneath, and over which, like a gauzy veil, the gray 
18010 shadow of dawn was hanging. With the exception of an Italian or two, 
18011 they were all French, the young fashionables who were the loungers of 
18012 the salons and cafes of the city. 
18017 “And the best chocolate I ever tasted out of Paris,” cried another. 
18019 “Thanks,” said Norwood. “We 'll profit by the good counsel.” And, taking 
18021 his paletot, he sat negligently on the wall, surveying the scene below 
18025 for the vacant and unoccupied stare of Onslow continued to cause the 
18026 Viscount the most intense anxiety. “These fellows are affecting to be 
18027 devilish cool. Let us not be behindhand.” And, rather by force than mere 
18028 persuasion, he dragged Onslow along, and entered the little parlor of 
18029 the inn. 
18031 A large table, covered with the remains of an ample breakfast, stood 
18032 in the middle of the room, and a dish of cutlets was placed to keep hot 
18033 before the stove. Several loose sheets of paper lay scattered about the 
18036 glanced at them for a moment, and then contemptuously threw them into 
18037 the fire. 
18039 “Sit down, George,” said he, placing a chair for the other; “and, if 
18041 suppose, in a few minutes. I told him to come with the doctor.” 
18044 the present is not the time to suggest one.” 
18052 “By Jove! he has got a tremendous scar on his cheek; the whole length, 
18053 from the eye to the corner of his mouth. English knuckles do not 
18058 “Well, you 've left him a memorandum of the transaction, any way,” 
18059  said the Viscount, as he ate on. “And you were talking about an apology 
18062 “I was wishing that the case admitted of one,” said Onslow, calmly. 
18064 Norwood gave a sidelong glance at the speaker, and, although he said 
18068 “Do try that brandy. Well, then, take a glass of curacoa,” said he, 
18069 pushing the bottle towards him. 
18072 to make my courage 'carry the bead;' but you are altogether mistaken in 
18079 as the adage says, 'only revient toujours.' Were I in your shoes this 
18080 morning, George, I 'd not leave one on the dish.” 
18084 “On that of the old Cardinal, who, when his doctors pronounced his case 
18086 a grand opportunity to indulge without the terror of an indigestion; and 
18087 _a propos_ to such themes, where can our worthy doctor be all this time? 
18088 The calessino was close up with us all the way.” 
18091 of the surgeon, but none had seen nor knew anything of him. An empty 
18092 calessino was standing on the roadside, but the driver only knew that 
18093 the gentleman who came with him had got out there, and entered the park. 
18095 “Then we shall find him near the little lake,” said Norwood, coolly, as 
18098 upon two seconds on either side. Like the gambler that always is calling 
18100 George, and see if the fellow knows nothing of Jekyl. You 've only to 
18104 George returned to the spot, but without any success. The man stated 
18105 that he took his stand, as he was desired, at the gate of the palace, 
18107 which way the others had gone, and how long before they had started. 
18108 “See that you pick them up then,” said he, “but don't pass them. He 
18109 talked incessantly,” added the man, “the whole way, but in such bad 
18112 yonder, and passed into the park, it was a relief to us both.” 
18114 George was just turning away, when his eye caught a glimpse of the 
18117 than the Val d'Arno around Florence. The beautiful city itself, capped 
18118 with many a dome and tower, the gigantic castle of the Bargello, the 
18119 graceful arch of the Baptistery, the massive facade of the Pitti, all, 
18120 even to the lone tower on the hill where Galileo watched, rich in 
18121 their storied memories; while on the gentle slope of the mountain stood 
18122 hundreds of beauteous villas, whose very names are like spells to the 
18123 imagination, and the Dante, the Alfieri, the Boccaccio, vie in interest 
18124 with the sterner realities of the Medici, the Pazzi, the Salviati, and 
18125 the Strozzi. What a flood of memory pours over the mind, to think how 
18127 alley of cedars, have witnessed the most intense passions, or the most 
18131 Not in such mood as this, however, did Onslow survey the scene. It was 
18132 in the rapt admiration of its picturesque beauty. The glittering river, 
18133 now seen and lost again, the waving tree-tops, the parterres of bright 
18134 flowers, the stately palaces, whose terraces were shadowed by the 
18135 magnolia, the oleander, and the fig, all made up a picture of rich and 
18136 beautiful effect, and he longed to throw himself on the deep grass and 
18138 heard the sharp cracking of a postilion's whip immediately beneath him, 
18140 all the power of eight horses to each could barely drag along against 
18141 the steep ascent. A mounted courier in advance proclaimed that the 
18142 travellers were persons of condition, and everything about the equipages 
18143 themselves indicated wealth and station. As Onslow knew all who moved 
18145 northward so early in the year, and, stepping into a little copse beside 
18146 the road, he waited for the carriages to pass. 
18148 They came slowly forward, now halting to “breathe” the weary horses, now 
18149 struggling for a brief space against the hill, and at last, turning a 
18150 sharp angle of the way, the first carriage drew short up, directly in 
18151 front of where he stood. The panels bore the flaunting and pretentious 
18153 tolerated in the rest of Europe, the Czar would not suffer within his 
18154 own dominions. As George glanced at these, he started, for a well-known 
18157 the words, but the accents were her own. “Oh for one look at her, 
18158 for the last time!” thought he; and dashed headlong through the copse 
18159 towards where, by another bend, the road made a rapid turn upwards. 
18161 Already the horses had regained their wind, and were away at a brisk 
18162 trot, as George tore onward through the closely interwoven branches and 
18163 thick underwood of the grove. There was no path, nor, once out of sight 
18164 or sound of the road, anything to guide him; but he dashed on, in the 
18165 direction he supposed the carriage must take. At every step the way grew 
18166 more intricate and difficult; the pits the peasants dig for chestnut 
18167 leaves, the little heaps collected for firewood, intercepted him at 
18168 each moment. With torn clothes and bleeding hands he still rushed madly, 
18170 scar, at last gained the open country just in time to see the second 
18171 carriage crowning the peak of the mountain above his head, while he 
18172 could hear the sharp, clanking sound of the drag as they fastened it to 
18173 the leading carriage. Any attempt to overtake them on the hill must 
18174 now be hopeless. He well knew the pace at which a continental postilion 
18175 descends a mountain, and how the steepest galleries of Alps and 
18177 see the winding zigzags of the road, and at each turning he fancied 
18179 vineyards from base to summit; but, from the steepness of its side, 
18180 these terraces were but narrow strips of ground, barely sufficient for 
18181 the vine-dresser to pass when tending his plants, or gathering in their 
18183 giddy sensation, and few could have surveyed the precipitous descent 
18185 object, to see Kate once, and for the last time. By a straight descent 
18186 of the mountain, leaping from terrace to terrace, it was possible for 
18187 him to reach the bottom before the carriages could traverse the winding 
18188 course of the road; and no sooner was the thought conceived than he 
18190 never seen these terraced flights of earth a true notion of the peril of 
18191 such an undertaking; but they who have beheld them will acknowledge 
18193 dropping from height to height, the slightest impulse will carry the 
18194 footsteps beyond the edge of the terrace, and then all self-control is 
18197 The youth whose nerves have been trained by the sports of fox-hunting 
18199 George never hesitated when once the undertaking seemed practicable. By 
18200 sidelong leaps he descended the first three or four terraces well and 
18201 safely. Impressed with the risk of the exploit, he never turned his eyes 
18202 from the spot whereon he meant to alight, and measured every bound with 
18203 accuracy. Suddenly, however, his attention was caught by the postilion's 
18204 bugle sounding, several hundred feet below him, and, in a bend of the 
18205 road, he saw the dust left by the fast-descending carriage. Forgetful of 
18207 tremendous bound cleared one terrace completely, and alighted on the one 
18209 was on the very verge of the cliff. Even yet his presence of mind might 
18210 have rescued him, when the loose masonry gave way, and carried him 
18211 down with it. He fell forwards, and headlong; the force of the descent 
18214 unconscious heap of clay, in the long grass of the valley. 
18216 Not fifty yards from where he lay, the carriages passed, and Kate even 
18217 leaned from the window to gaze upon the winding glen, little thinking 
18218 how terrible an interest that quiet scene was filled with. And so the 
18219 equipages held their speed, and pressed onward; while, with a faint
